MODEL'S ANSWER: To get all distinct countries where singers above age 20 are from, you can write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country" 
FROM "singer" 
WHERE "Age" > 20;
```

This query selects the distinct values from the "Country" column in the "singer" table, but only for those singers who are above 20 years old. The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows where the "Age" is 20 or below.

Your SQL query should use column country.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 273
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the different countries with singers above age 20, we can write an SQL query that selects the `Country` column from the `singer` table where the `Age` is greater than 20. We'll use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we get unique countries. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Age" > 20;
```

This query will return a list of unique countries where there are singers older than 20 years of age.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .

Your SQL query should use columns song_name and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find all song names by singers above the average age, first, we need to determine the average age of all singers. Then, we can select the song names from the singers who are above this average age. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query works in two steps:

1. The subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` computes the average age of all singers.
2. The outer query selects all the `Song_Name`s from the `singer` table where the `Age` of the singer is greater than the average age determined in the subquery.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 288
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out the stadium with the most number of concerts from 2014 onwards, we'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Filter out concerts that happened in 2014 or after.
2. Count concerts for each stadium.
3. Identify the stadium with the maximum count.
4. Join the above results with the stadium table to get its name and capacity.

Here is how you can write this SQL query:

```sql
WITH ConcertCounts AS (
    SELECT
        c.Stadium_ID,
        COUNT(c.concert_ID) AS ConcertCount
    FROM
        concert c
    WHERE
        CAST(c.Year AS INT) >= 2014
    GROUP BY
        c.Stadium_ID
),
MaxConcertCounts AS (
    SELECT
        Stadium_ID,
        ConcertCount
    FROM
        ConcertCounts
    WHERE
        ConcertCount = (SELECT MAX(ConcertCount) FROM ConcertCounts)
)
SELECT
    s.Name,
    s.Capacity
FROM
    stadium s
JOIN
    MaxConcertCounts mcc
ON
    s.Stadium_ID = mcc.Stadium_ID;
```

Explanation of the Query:

- The `ConcertCounts` Common Table Expression (CTE) selects the `Stadium_ID` and counts the number of concerts for each stadium that occurred in 2014 or later.
- The `MaxConcertCounts` CTE finds the stadium(s) with the maximum number of concerts by comparing the counts to the maximum count obtained.
- Finally, we `JOIN` the `MaxConcertCounts` CTE with the `stadium` table to get the name and capacity of the stadium(s) with the most number of concerts.

Please note that if there are multiple stadiums that host the maximum number of concerts, this query will return all of them. If you are sure that there will only be one stadium with the maximum number of concerts or you only want one, you could add a limit to the final SELECT statement. Also, this query assumes that the `Stadium_ID` in the `concert` table is meant to be an integer type in the same way as in the `stadium` table; otherwise, a cast or conversion will be necessary.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?

Your SQL query should use columns name and stadium_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums without any concerts, we can perform a LEFT JOIN between the "stadium" table and the "concert" table on the "Stadium_ID" column. We can then use a WHERE clause to filter for rows where there is no matching "concert_ID" on the "concert" side (i.e., where "concert"."Stadium_ID" IS NULL).

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  s.Stadium_ID
FROM
  stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c
  ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
  c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query selects the Name and Stadium_ID from the "stadium" table and retrieves only those stadiums that do not have a corresponding entry in the "concert" table.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .

Your SQL query should use columns concert_name, theme, and concert_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 285
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill the given request, a query needs to be made that joins the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the number of singers associated with each concert. The `GROUP BY` clause will be used to group the results by `concert_ID`, and an aggregate function, `COUNT()`, will be used to calculate the number of singers.

Here is the SQL query that shows the `concert_name`, `theme`, and the number of singers for each concert:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name,
    c.Theme,
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) as Number_of_Singers
FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID,
    c.concert_Name,
    c.Theme;
```

In this query, I used a LEFT JOIN because we want to include all concerts even if there are no singers associated with them (in which case, the count would be 0). The `COUNT(sic.Singer_ID)` function counts the number of singers per concert, and the results are grouped by the `concert_ID` as well as the `concert_Name` and `Theme` to ensure the correct grouping and aggregation. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all concerts will be returned even if no singers participated in some concerts.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?

Your SQL query should use columns name, country, and song_name.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 292
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we need to select these columns from the "singer" table and filter the results for songs that include the specified word in the song name. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country, Song_Name
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey %';
```

The percentage signs `%` are wildcards in the SQL `LIKE` operator, which allow for any number of characters to be present before or after the word 'Hey'. Note that the space after 'Hey' is to ensure that we're matching titles with 'Hey' as a word, not as a syllable as part of another word. However, if you need to match 'Hey' as a standalone word anywhere in the title, you would need to account for other scenarios as well (e.g., 'Hey' at the end of the title or preceded/followed by punctuation). If that's the case, the query would need to be adjusted.

For example, if you also need to find song titles where 'Hey' is at the end or 'Hey' is followed by punctuation, the query could become more complex. As an example, we'll cover the case for 'Hey' at the start, middle, or end of the title, like so:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country, Song_Name
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey %' OR Song_Name LIKE 'Hey %' OR Song_Name LIKE '% Hey' OR Song_Name LIKE '% Hey%';
```

However, please note that SQL pattern matching is limited and may not account for all punctuation without more complex logic or use of regular expressions (which are not standard SQL and would depend on the specific SQL database you are using).

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query will return the total number of unique pets owned by students who are older than 20 years of age.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .

Your SQL query should use columns stuid, petid, sex, and pettype.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 204
MODEL'S ANSWER: For this query, we will need to join the Student table with the Has_Pet table first to get the students who have pets and then join the resulting set with the Pets table to filter out the dogs. We are interested in female students (indicated by `Sex='F'`) who have dogs (`PetType='dog'`). The following SQL query should give us the desired result:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```
This query counts the number of rows that satisfy both conditions: the student's sex must be 'F', and the pet type must be 'dog'. The result will be the number of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list each continent with the number of countries in it, you'll need to join the `continents` table with the `countries` table and then perform a count aggregation based on continents. Here is the SQL query that will give you the results you're looking for:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId, 
    c.Continent, 
    COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM 
    continents c
LEFT JOIN 
    countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY 
    c.ContId
```

This query will return the number of countries associated with each continent, along with the continent's ID and name. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even the continents with no countries will be included in the results with a count of 0. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the results by continent.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To count the number of models each car maker produces and list their full names, IDs, and the number of models, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT cm.FullName, cm.Id, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName
ORDER BY cm.Id;
```

This query does the following:
- It joins the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables on the shared `Id` and `Maker` columns, respectively.
- It groups the results by `car_makers.Id` and `car_makers.FullName`.
- It counts the number of models associated with each car maker using `COUNT(ml.ModelId)`.
- It orders the results by `car_makers.Id`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 354
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker along with its ID and the number of models it produces, we will need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and use the `COUNT` function to count the number of models associated with each maker. We will group this by the car maker's ID and FullName. Here's the SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This `LEFT JOIN` makes sure that even if a car maker doesn't have any models associated with it, it will still appear in the result list with a count of 0 for the number of models.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 346
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, one possible query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cd.Horsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'NA'
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the model and horsepower from the joined tables `cars_data` and `car_names` while handling possible non-numeric values denoted as 'NA' by excluding them. It orders the results by the horsepower in ascending order and limits the result to just 1 record, which would be the one with the minimum horsepower. 

Note: `CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)` is used to cast the `Horsepower` column to an INTEGER for proper numeric comparison as long as `Horsepower` is stored as TEXT. If 'NA' values are present, this will omit them to avoid casting errors. If the 'NA' data should be really treated as a minimum value, then the WHERE clause needs to be removed and the casting needs adjustment. If there are no 'NA' values, the WHERE clause is unnecessary.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 349
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the distinct car models produced after the year 1980, we need to join the `model_list` and `cars_data` tables based on the relationship between `model_list.ModelId` and `cars_data.Id`. Here's an example SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ml.Model
FROM model_list AS ml
JOIN cars_data AS cd ON ml.ModelId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return the unique models of cars that have a `Year` value greater than 1980, taking into account the join between the two tables on their respective `ModelId` and `Id` columns. The request for specific columns (`model`, `makeid`, `id`, `year`) is not directly relevant to this query because the user has asked for distinct car models, hence we selected only the `ml.model`. If those were required in the result set, you would need to adjust the `SELECT` statement accordingly. However, since we are looking for distinct models, including non-distinct columns would be inappropriate.
