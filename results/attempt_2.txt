PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 390
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we first need to calculate the average age of all singers and then select the song names from those singers whose age is above this average.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
WITH AverageAge AS (
    SELECT AVG(Age) AS AvgAge
    FROM "singer"
)

SELECT "Name", "Song_Name"
FROM "singer", AverageAge
WHERE "singer"."Age" > AverageAge.AvgAge;
```

This query defines a common table expression (CTE) named `AverageAge` that calculates the average age of all singers. Then, it selects the names and song names of the singers from the `singer` table where their ages are greater than the average age calculated in the `AverageAge` CTE.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 398
MODEL'S ANSWER: In order to find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts from the year 2014 onward, we have to do several steps. Firstly, we must filter the concerts that occurred in 2014 or after. Secondly, we need to count the number of concerts each stadium had. Lastly, we would display the stadium name and capacity for the stadium with the maximum count. 

Here is an SQL query that will accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name AS Stadium_Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query does the following:

1. Joins the `stadium` table with the `concert` table on the `Stadium_ID` field.
2. Filters the concerts to include only those from the year 2014 and onward using the `WHERE` clause.
3. Groups the result by `Stadium_ID`, `Name`, and `Capacity` so that we can count the number of concerts per stadium.
4. Orders the result in descending order based on the count of concerts.
5. Limits the result to only the top row, which corresponds to the stadium with the highest number of concerts.

Please note that if there is more than one stadium with the same maximum number of concerts, this query will show only one of them due to the `LIMIT 1` clause. If you want to display all stadiums with the maximum count in case of a tie, you'd need a slightly more complex query.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 396
MODEL'S ANSWER: To achieve this, you will want to join the "concert" table with the "singer_in_concert" table to count the number of singers per concert. Then group the results by concert to get the count for each one.

Here's the SQL query to perform this task:

```sql

GROUP BY c.concert_ID, c.concert_Name, c.Theme;
```

This query uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all concerts are listed, even if there are no singers associated with that concert. This will include concerts with zero singers. The results include the concert name, theme, and a count of the number of singers in each concert.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 390
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names and the number of concerts each singer has participated in, we need to join the `singer` table and the `singer_in_concert` table, and then count the number of concerts for each singer. We'll group the results by the `Singer_ID` and `Name`.

Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS NumberOfConcerts
FROM
    singer s
LEFT JOIN
    singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
    s.Singer_ID;
```

This query will give you a list of singer names and the count of concerts they've been associated with, grouped by each singer. We are using a LEFT JOIN because we wish to include singers even if they haven't participated in any concerts. If a singer has no concert entries, they will still appear in the result with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 404
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in the title, we need to select from the "singer" table where the "Song_Name" includes 'Hey'. Given that SQL uses the percentage symbol (%) as a wildcard for zero, one, or multiple characters when using the `LIKE` operator, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query searches for all singers where the "Song_Name" contains 'Hey', regardless of where it appears in the string. Remember that `LIKE` is case-insensitive in some SQL databases, and case-sensitive in others, so if the case matters in your scenario, you should use the appropriate collation or binary comparison.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 264
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students who are over the age of 20, we need to perform a join between the tables `Student` and `Has_Pet` to filter students by their age and then count the number of distinct pets they own. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query will give us the count of unique pets owned by students older than 20 years of age.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 488
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of countries each continent has, we need to join the "continents" table with the "countries" table and count the occurrences of countries for each continent. We'll use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by each continent and count the number of countries associated with each continent. Here is the SQL query to obtain this information:

```sql
SELECT
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent,
    COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM
    continents c
LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY NumberOfCountries DESC;
```

This query selects the continent id (`c.ContId`), continent name (`c.Continent`), and number of countries (`COUNT(co.CountryId)`). It performs a LEFT JOIN between continents (`c`) and countries (`co`) on their respective continent id fields. Then it groups the result by `c.ContId` and `c.Continent`, counting the countries in each group. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the number of countries in descending order.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 486
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and count the number of models for each maker. Here's how you can do it with SQL:

```sql
SELECT cm.FullName, cm.Id, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers AS cm
JOIN model_list AS ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName
ORDER BY NumberOfModels DESC;
```

This query will give you a list of car makers along with their full name, ID, and the number of models they produce, ordered from the ones with the most models to the ones with the least. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the results for each car maker, and `COUNT` is used to get the number of models for each group (car maker).

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 488
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker, along with its ID and the number of models it produces, we can write a SQL query that joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and counts the number of models per maker. We would group by the car maker's ID and include the maker's full name.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id, 
    cm.FullName, 
    COUNT(ml.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, 
    cm.FullName;
```

This query performs a `LEFT JOIN` on `car_makers` and `model_list` based on the car maker's ID (`cm.Id`) and the maker reference in the model list (`ml.Maker`). Then, it groups the result by the maker's ID and full name and uses `COUNT` to tally the number of models associated with each car maker. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even car makers with no models will be included in the results with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 477
MODEL'S ANSWER: In order to find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we first need to find the `Horsepower` value converted from TEXT to INTEGER so we can compare the numerical values. Then, after finding the minimum value, we need to join the appropriate tables to retrieve the related car model.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM cars_data AS cd
JOIN car_names AS cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower = (
    SELECT MIN(CAST(Horsepower AS INTEGER))
    FROM cars_data
    WHERE Horsepower <> 'NA' -- Exclude non-numeric values
)
```

Let's break down this query:

1. The `CAST` function is used to convert the `Horsepower` from TEXT to INTEGER for proper comparison.
2. The `MIN()` function is used to find the minimum value of `Horsepower` while excluding any rows where `Horsepower` might be set to 'NA' or any non-numeric placeholder.
3. We perform a join between `cars_data` and `car_names` using the `Id` and `MakeId` columns to get the corresponding car model.
4. Retrieve the car model(s) where the `Horsepower` matches the minimum value found.

Please note that if there are multiple models with the same minimum horsepower, this query will return all of them. If you run this query in the database with the real data, you might need to handle potential issues like `Horsepower` being non-numeric or missing. The example provided assumed 'NA' as a potential non-numeric value, hence the `WHERE Horsepower <> 'NA'` condition. If there are other non-numeric indicators, you would need to add conditions for those as well.

```sql

This query retrieves distinct models from the "car_names" table ("cn" is an alias) by joining it with the "cars_data" table ("cd" is an alias) where the primary key "MakeId" matches the "Id". The `WHERE` clause filters the rows for cars produced after the year 1980.
