PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 264
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find all song names by singers above the average age, we need to calculate the average age of all singers first, and then select song names of singers whose age is above this average. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query has a subquery that calculates the average age of singers by using the `AVG()` function on the `Age` column in the `singer` table. Then, the outer query selects the `Song_Name` from the `singer` table only for those records where the `Age` is greater than the average age found in the subquery.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 272
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in 2014 or after, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Filter the `concert` table to get all records with `Year` equal to or greater than 2014.
2. Join this filtered `concert` table with the `stadium` table based on `Stadium_ID`.
3. Group the results by the stadium and count the number of concerts for each stadium.
4. Order the results by the count of concerts in descending order to put the stadium with the most concerts at the top.
5. Limit the result to 1 to get the stadium with the maximum number of concerts.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name,
       s.Capacity,
       COUNT(c.concert_ID) as NumberOfConcerts
FROM concert c
JOIN stadium s ON c.Stadium_ID = s.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY NumberOfConcerts DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will give us the name and capacity of the stadium that has hosted the most number of concerts since the beginning of the year 2014.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 264
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums without any concerts, we need to perform a LEFT JOIN between the "stadium" table and the "concert" table and look for rows where there are no matching concert records in the "concert" table (i.e., where the concert details are `NULL`). 

Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query joins the "stadium" and "concert" tables on the "Stadium_ID" column and selects the "Name" from the "stadium" table where there is no corresponding "concert_ID" in the "concert" table (indicating no concerts are associated with that stadium).

MODEL'S ANSWER: To accomplish this, we'll need to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the number of singers per concert. We'll then group the results by `concert_ID` and select the relevant information. Here's the SQL query you would use:

```

In this query:
- We're selecting the `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table.
- We're using a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure that we get all concerts even if there are no associated singers in the `singer_in_concert` table.
- We're counting the number of singers by counting the `Singer_ID`s in the `singer_in_concert` table.
- We're grouping the results by `concert_ID` to ensure we get a count for each concert.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names and the number of concerts for each singer, we can use the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables. We would perform a `LEFT JOIN` from `singer` to `singer_in_concert` on the `Singer_ID` key and then group by the `Singer_ID` to count the number of concerts for each. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql

GROUP BY

```

This query will return a result set with the names of the singers and the corresponding number of concerts they have participated in. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a singer has not participated in any concerts, they will still be included in the results with a count of `0`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 184
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this question, we need to write a query that joins the Student and Has_Pet tables, filters for students who are older than 20 years of age, and then counts the distinct number of pets owned by these students. Here is the query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query works as follows:
- `FROM Student` starts from the Student table
- `JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID` joins the Has_Pet table to the Student table on the `StuID` column
- `WHERE Student.Age > 20` adds a condition to only include students older than 20 years
- `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets` counts the distinct `PetID` entries, which are the IDs of the pets owned by these students, and aliases the count as `NumberOfPets`.

When this query is executed against a database with the described table structures and data, it will return the total number of distinct pets owned by students over the age of 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 186
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, you need to join the `Student`, `Has_Pet`, and `Pets` tables, filter the results by the `Sex` of the student and the `PetType`. Here is the SQL query that would give you the desired result:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) as NumberOfDogPets

JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query will provide the count of uniquely identified dog pets that are associated with students who are female. We use `COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID)` to ensure that each pet is only counted once, even if it appears more than once in the `Has_Pet` table (which should not happen if data integrity is maintained, but it's good practice to count distinct values in cases where duplicates might exist).

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 341
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of countries for each continent, you'll need to join the "continents" table with the "countries" table and use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by continent. You can then use the COUNT() aggregate function to count the number of countries in each group. Here's how you can write the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent, 
    COUNT(cn.CountryId) as NumberOfCountries
FROM 
    continents c
LEFT JOIN 
    countries cn ON c.ContId = cn.Continent
GROUP BY 
    c.ContId, c.Continent;
```

This query selects the continent id (`ContId`), continent name (`Continent`), and the number of countries (`NumberOfCountries`) in each continent. The LEFT JOIN ensures that you also list continents that have no countries.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 339
MODEL'S ANSWER: To count the number of models each car maker produces, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table. We can then group the results by the car maker's ID to calculate the number of models each maker produces. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    cm.Id AS MakerId,
    cm.FullName AS MakerFullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM
    car_makers cm
JOIN
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY
    cm.Id
ORDER BY
    NumberOfModels DESC;
```

This query will produce a result set listing each car maker's full name and ID along with the number of models they have. It also orders the results by the number of models in descending order, so you can see which maker produces the most models at the top.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 341
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Use the `car_makers` table to retrieve the `Id` and `FullName` of each car maker.
2. Join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table to associate each car maker with the models they produce.
3. Count the number of models that each car maker produces using a GROUP BY clause on the car maker's `Id`.
4. Select the `Id`, `FullName`, and the count of models for each car maker.

Here is the SQL query to accomplish this task:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query will return a list of car makers along with their full names, their IDs, and the number of models they produce. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a car maker has no models, it will still be included in the result with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 330
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model with the minimum horsepower, we first need to identify the rows in the `cars_data` table where `Horsepower` is not null and is not a non-numeric text (since we're dealing with a text field that could potentially contain non-numeric values). Then we have to convert the `Horsepower` field to a numeric type to find the minimum value and join it with the `car_names` table to get the model name.

Here's how you would write the query:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd
ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA' -- Exclude non-applicable horsepower values
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC -- Convert to integer and sort
LIMIT 1; -- Get only the top result
```

This SQL statement will give you the model name of the car with the minimum horsepower out of all the entries in the `cars_data` table that have a valid `Horsepower` value. The `<> 'NA'` part of the `WHERE` clause assumes that `'NA'` might be used to represent non-applicable or missing values, so we need to filter these out. If there is a different placeholder for non-numeric or missing values, adjust the WHERE clause accordingly.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 332
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find distinct car models produced after the year 1980, we will need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table and then filter the results where the `Year` is greater than 1980. Once we've made this selection, we'll use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure we're returning unique models only.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
INNER JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query performs the following actions:

1. Selects the distinct `Model` column from the `car_names` table aliased as `cn`.
2. Joins the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table aliased as `cd` where the `MakeId` column from `car_names` corresponds to the `Id` column in `cars_data`.
3. Filters the results to include only those entries where the `Year` column in `cars_data` is greater than 1980.
