PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 377
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we can perform the following query:

First, we need to determine the average age of the singers. Then, we can select the song names from those singers with an age above this average.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query will return a list of `Song_Name` from the `singer` table where the singer's `Age` is above the average age. The average age is calculated by the subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` and then used in the outer query to filter the results.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 385
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after and show its name and capacity, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Join the `concert` and `stadium` tables on the `Stadium_ID` column.
2. Filter the results to include only the concerts from the year 2014 or after.
3. Group the results by the stadium details.
4. Count the number of concerts for each stadium.
5. Order the results by the count of concerts in a descending order.
6. Select the top result to find the stadium with the most number of concerts.

Here is the SQL query that performs these steps:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the name and capacity of the stadium that has hosted the most number of concerts from 2014 onwards. If multiple stadiums have the same maximum number of concerts, this query will return only one of them.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 377
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of stadiums that have not hosted any concerts, you would join the `stadium` table and the `concert` table on their `Stadium_ID` fields, and then select those stadiums for which there is no corresponding entry in the `concert` table (i.e., they haven't hosted a concert). Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query uses a LEFT JOIN to join the `stadium` table with the `concert` table and selects rows where the `concert_ID` from the `concert` table is null, indicating there is no concert for that particular stadium. The selected column is `Name` from the `stadium` table, which contains the names of the stadiums.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 383
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this request, we'll need to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the number of singers in each concert. The SQL query should look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name,
    c.Theme,
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) AS NumberOfSingers
FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID;
```

Let's go over the components of the query:

1. We're selecting the `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table.
2. We're joining the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table using a LEFT JOIN operation on the `concert_ID` to make sure we include concerts that don't have any singers. This is important as an INNER JOIN would omit concerts without singers from the results.
3. We use the `COUNT` aggregate function on `sic.Singer_ID` to count the number of singers in each concert.
4. Finally, we use the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the count per concert based on `concert_ID`.

This will give us a list of all concerts, their themes, and the number of singers that participated in each concert. If there were no performers at a concert, it should still appear in the list with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 391
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we need to run a SQL SELECT query on the "singer" table and filter the results to only include rows where the "Song_Name" column contains the word 'Hey'. Here's the query:

```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Song_Name" LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This SQL query uses the LIKE operator with the `%` wildcard characters to search for any records where the "Song_Name" contains 'Hey' anywhere in the string. Please note that the query is case-sensitive; if you want it to be case-insensitive, you might need to use the ILIKE operator depending on the SQL database you are using:

```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Song_Name" ILIKE '%Hey%';
```

However, ILIKE is a PostgreSQL-specific operator, and if you are using another database system, you might need to apply other techniques to achieve case-insensitivity, such as using LOWER or UPPER functions on both the column and the search term:

```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE LOWER("Song_Name") LIKE LOWER('%Hey%');
```

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 251
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students older than 20, we need to join the `Student` and `Has_Pet` tables and count the number of pet entries for qualifying students. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Student 
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query joins the `Student` and `Has_Pet` tables on the `StuID` column and uses a `WHERE` clause to filter out students whose age is less than or equal to 20. It then counts the number of rows from the resulting set, which gives us the number of pets owned by students over 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 253
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, we need to join the tables `Student`, `Has_Pet`, and `Pets`, then count the number of dogs that belong to students of sex 'F'. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query starts by selecting students from the `Student` table where `Sex` is 'F' (female). Then it joins the `Has_Pet` table on `StuID` to find the pets associated with those students. It further joins the `Pets` table on `PetID` to identify the type of pets. The `WHERE` clause filters the results for only female students who have dogs. Finally, the `COUNT(*)` function is used to get the total number of matching records, which corresponds to the number of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 475
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many countries each continent has, you'll need to use the `countries` table to group the countries by continent and then count them. Join this results with the `continents` table to get the continent names. The SQL query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(co.CountryId) as NumberOfCountries
FROM continents c
LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent;
```

Breaking it down, here's what the individual parts of the query do:
- `FROM continents c`: This tells SQL to select data from the `continents` table and alias it as `c` for brevity.
- `LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent`: This joins the `countries` table (aliased as `co`) to the `continents` table, matching rows where the `ContId` in the `continents` table matches the `Continent` in the `countries` table. A `LEFT JOIN` ensures all continents are listed even if they have no countries.
- `GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent`: This groups the results by continent id and continent name, which is necessary for the count to work correctly.
- `COUNT(co.CountryId) as NumberOfCountries`: This counts the number of `CountryId` in each group, giving the number of countries in each continent. It's labeled as `NumberOfCountries` for clarity in the output.

Executing this query will give you a list with the continent id (ContId), the continent name (Continent), and the number of countries (NumberOfCountries) on each continent.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 473
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, along with the maker's full name and ID, we need to join the "car_makers" table with the "model_list" table, group by car maker, and then count the number of different models for each maker.

The query will be as follows:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as ModelCount
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query will return a list with each car maker's ID, their full name, and the total number of models they produce. The JOIN operation combines rows from "car_makers" and "model_list" based on the car maker's Id, and the GROUP BY clause is then used to aggregate the count of models for each car maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 475
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker, along with its ID and the number of models it produces, you need to perform an aggregation using a COUNT function along with a JOIN operation that brings together the related tables.

Here's the SQL query that would give you the desired result:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers AS cm
LEFT JOIN model_list AS ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName
ORDER BY cm.Id;
```

This query does the following:

- Selects the `Id` and `FullName` from the `car_makers` table.
- Left joins the `model_list` table to count the number of models for each maker.
- Groups the results by `car_makers.Id` and `car_makers.FullName` to ensure the count is per unique car maker.
- Counts the number of `ModelId` from the `model_list` for each car maker using `COUNT(ml.ModelId)` and aliases it as `NumberOfModels`.
- Optionally orders the result set by `car_makers.Id` for better readability.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 464
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we first need to identify the minimum value of horsepower across all cars. `Horsepower` is a TEXT field, so we need to convert it to an integer to perform a comparison. After finding the minimum value, we can then find the model associated with that value.

Here's a query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
  m.Model,
  MIN(CAST(c.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) as MinHorsepower
FROM 
  cars_data c
JOIN 
  car_names n ON c.Id = n.MakeId
JOIN 
  model_list m ON n.Model = m.Model
WHERE 
  c.Horsepower != 'NA' -- Exclude non-numeric values
GROUP BY 
  m.Model
ORDER BY 
  MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

The query above does the following:
- It joins the `cars_data`, `car_names`, and `model_list` tables to associate horsepower with models.
- It converts the horsepower from a TEXT datatype to an INTEGER so that it can find the minimum value.
- It filters out rows where Horsepower is 'NA' which indicates missing data.
- It groups by the model to ensure we have the models listed correctly.
- It orders by the minimum horsepower in ascending order to get the lowest at the top.
- It limits the result to just 1 row to get the car with the minimum horsepower. 

Keep in mind that there could be the possibility of more than one car model having the same minimum horsepower, and this query will only give you one of them. If you want all models with the minimum horsepower, you would need to first determine the minimum horsepower and then select all models that have that horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 466
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we will need to join the tables `model_list` and `cars_data`, using the appropriate keys. Then, we will filter the results where the Year is greater than 1980 in the `cars_data` table.

Here's the SQL query that will get us the information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ml.Model
FROM model_list AS ml
JOIN car_names AS cn ON ml.ModelId = cn.MakeId
JOIN cars_data AS cd ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query is doing the following:

1. Joining `model_list` (as `ml`) with `car_names` (as `cn`), matching `ml.ModelId` to `cn.MakeId`.
2. Then, it's joining `car_names` (as `cn`) with `cars_data` (as `cd`), matching `cd.Id` to `cn.MakeId`.
