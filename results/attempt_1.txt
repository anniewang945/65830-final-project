Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. concert.stadium_id
2. concert.year
3. stadium.stadium_id
4. stadium.name
5. stadium.capacity

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 331
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in 2014 or after, we will first need to count the number of concerts for each stadium from the year 2014 onwards. Then we will find the stadium that has the highest count.

Here is the SQL query to retrieve the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts from the year 2014 and onwards:

```sql
SELECT 
  s.Name,
  s.Capacity
FROM 
  stadium s
JOIN 
  concert c
ON 
  s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE 
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY 
  s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY 
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC -- Order by the number of concerts in descending order to find the most
LIMIT 1; -- Select only the top stadium with the most concerts
```
This query first joins the `stadium` table with the `concert` table on their `Stadium_ID` column. It then filters for concerts from the year 2014 onwards. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by stadium details, and within this group, we count the number of occurrences of `concert_ID` that corresponds to each stadium. The `ORDER BY` clause then orders these groups so that the stadium with the highest count of concerts is at the top (`DESC` for descending order). Lastly, we limit the results to one, so we only get the stadium with the most concerts since 2014.

1. stadium.name
2. stadium.stadium_id
3. concert.stadium_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 313
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums without any concerts, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `stadium` table with the `concert` table and look for records that have a NULL value in `concert.stadium_id` after the join. This identifies stadiums that aren't linked to any concert.

Here is the SQL query that should give you the required result:

```sql
SELECT
    stadium.Name
FROM
    stadium
LEFT JOIN concert ON stadium.Stadium_ID = concert.Stadium_ID
WHERE
    concert.Stadium_ID IS NULL;
```
This query selects the name of the stadium from the `stadium` table and left joins it with the `concert` table on their `Stadium_ID`. It then filters for the stadiums where the `Stadium_ID` in the `concert` table was not found (hence is `NULL`).

2. concert.concert_name
3. concert.theme
4. concert.concert_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 329
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, we can perform a query that joins `concert` with `singer_in_concert` and then use COUNT aggregation to get the number of singers in each concert. The query will look as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_name,
    c.theme,
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) as number_of_singers
FROM

GROUP BY

```

This query selects the concert name and theme from the `concert` table and counts the number of singer IDs from the `singer_in_concert` table associated with each concert, grouping the results by concert ID, name, and theme. The LEFT JOIN ensures that even if a concert does not have any singers, it will still appear in the results with a count of 0.

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. singer.name
2. singer.country
3. singer.song_name

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 324
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we can use a `SELECT` statement that specifies the required columns, and includes a `WHERE` condition to filter the results based on the song title containing the word 'Hey'. Since you mentioned 'Hey ' with a space after it, I will match it as if it's the start or an entire word within the title and not as part of another word. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    singer.Name,
    singer.Country
FROM 
    singer
WHERE 
    singer.Song_Name LIKE '%Hey %' OR
    singer.Song_Name LIKE '%Hey';
```

The `%` symbol used in the `LIKE` condition is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters. This query assumes that 'Hey ' might also appear at the end of a song title or as a standalone word, which is why I've provided an OR condition to account for that possibility. If 'Hey' always comes with a trailing space, as in the middle of a title, you can remove the second condition after OR.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 232
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students over the age of 20, we need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table, where we will filter out the students by their age.

```

This query joins the `Student` table with `Has_Pet` on the `StuID` field, filters the resulting rows to those where the student's age is greater than 20, and then counts the distinct `PetID`s to determine the number of pets owned by those students.

2. student.sex
3. has_pet.stuid
4. has_pet.petid
5. pets.petid
6. pets.pettype

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 253
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students, you need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table based on the `StuID`, then join the resulting dataset with the `Pets` table based on the `PetID`. You will then apply a filter condition to only consider female students and dogs. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
WHERE Student.Sex = 'F' AND Pets.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query returns the total count of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. continents.contid
2. continents.continent
3. countries.continent
SQL:  select t1.contid ,  t1.continent ,  count(*) from continents as t1 
join countries as t2 on t1.contid  =  t2.continent group by t1.contid;
Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 448
MODEL'S ANSWER: Your provided query is almost correct, but you need to include `t1.continent` in the `GROUP BY` clause to accurately group the results by both the continent ID and the continent name. Here is the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT 
  t1.ContId, 
  t1.Continent,  
  COUNT(*) AS NumberOfCountries 
FROM 
  continents AS t1 
  JOIN countries AS t2 ON t1.ContId = t2.Continent 
GROUP BY 
  t1.ContId, 
  t1.Continent;
```

The query will return the continent id (`ContId`), continent name (`Continent`), and count of countries for each continent. The `JOIN` operation combines rows from the `continents` table with those from the `countries` table where the `ContId` matches the corresponding `Continent` in the `countries` table. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `ContId` and `Continent`, and the `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of countries within each group (continent).

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 393
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the full name of each car maker, along with its ID and the number of models it produces, you would need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on the maker id, then count the number of models per maker. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  car_makers.Id,
  car_makers.FullName,
  COUNT(model_list.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
  car_makers
LEFT JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY
  car_makers.Id;
```

This query performs a LEFT JOIN operation because we want to include car makers even if they don't have any models in the model_list table (in which case, the count for models would be 0 for those makers). We group by `car_makers.Id` to ensure we get a count of models for each car maker. The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of models associated with each maker, and we alias this count as `NumberOfModels`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_names.model
2. car_names.makeid
3. cars_data.id
4. cars_data.horsepower

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 387
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, you first have to account for non-numeric values in the `Horsepower` column which could be represented by NULL or any other placeholder indicating missing data. Assuming that the `Horsepower` column may contain some non-numeric values, we could use a WHERE clause to filter out those entries. However, if all entries in the `Horsepower` column are guaranteed to be numeric or NULL, you could directly use the MIN() aggregate function along with a JOIN to associate a model with its horsepower value.

Let's write a query that handles potential non-numeric values by ignoring them (assuming that non-numeric values are empty strings or NULL):

```sql
SELECT car_names.Model, MIN(CAST(cars_data.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) as MinHorsepower
FROM cars_data
JOIN car_names ON cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId
WHERE TRIM(cars_data.Horsepower) <> '' -- Filters out non-numeric values; remove this line if all values are guaranteed to be numeric
GROUP BY car_names.Model
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC, car_names.Model
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the model of the car with the minimum horsepower. Here is what each part does:

1. We join `car_names` and `cars_data` on `MakeId` and `Id` respectively to get the model names and their corresponding horsepower.
2. We use `CAST` to ensure `Horsepower` is treated as an integer for the purpose of finding a minimum.
3. The `WHERE` clause filters out any non-numeric entries for `Horsepower` assuming they are represented by empty strings; remove this line if all values are indeed numeric.
4. We group by `Model` because you want to find a distinct model, not every instance of it.
5. We then order by the minimum horsepower in ascending order. If there are models with the same horsepower, it will also be ordered by `Model`.
6. Finally, we limit the results to just 1 entry which represents the model with the minimum horsepower. 

Please note that if the `Horsepower` values are all numeric, you could omit the `WHERE` clause, and if the non-numeric representations are not empty strings but something else (like 'NA' or NULL) the `WHERE` condition should be adjusted accordingly.
