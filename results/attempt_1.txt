PASSING USER PROMPT: What are all distinct countries where singers above age 20 are from ?
Your SQL query should use columns country.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get all distinct countries where singers above age 20 are from, you can use a `SELECT DISTINCT` query on the "singer" table, while filtering with a `WHERE` clause for those singers who are above age 20. Here's the SQL query that retrieves this information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Age" > 20;
```

This SQL query selects all unique country names from the "singer" table where the age of the singer is greater than 20 years.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the different countries with singers above age 20 ?

Your SQL query should use column country.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 273
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the distinct countries of singers who are above the age of 20, you would use the `DISTINCT` keyword to avoid duplicates, and filter the results where the `Age` column is greater than 20. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Age" > 20;
```

PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .

Your SQL query should use columns song_name and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get all the song names by singers above the average age, you first need to find out what the average age is and then select the song names from singers who are above that average. Here's how you could do that with SQL:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (
  SELECT AVG(s2.Age)
  FROM singer s2
)
```

In this query, we are selecting the `Song_Name` from the `singer` table where the `Age` of the singer is greater than the average age derived from the `singer` table. The average is calculated by the subquery:

```sql
SELECT AVG(s2.Age)
FROM singer s2
```

This subquery returns the average age of all singers in the `singer` table, and then the main query uses this result to filter the singers above this average age.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 288
MODEL'S ANSWER: To achieve the requested information, we'll need to join the "stadium" table with the "concert" table to get the number of concerts at each stadium, then filter by concerts in the year 2014 and after. After that, we'll aggregate data to count the number of concerts per stadium, and finally, we will order by the count of concerts in descending order and limit the result to the stadium with the most concerts.

Here is the SQL query that retrieves the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  s.Capacity
FROM
  stadium s
JOIN
  concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY
  s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT

```

Please be aware that if there are ties for the highest number of concerts, this query will only display one of those stadiums. If you want to display all tied stadiums, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.

Your SQL query should use columns name and stadium_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of stadiums that do not have any concerts, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` combined with a `WHERE` clause to identify stadiums with no matching concert entries. Here's the SQL query for it:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Stadium_ID
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query retrieves the names and ids of all stadiums and then left joins them with the concert table on `Stadium_ID`. The condition `WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL` ensures only stadiums without a corresponding concert are returned.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?

Your SQL query should use colums stuid and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 196
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students who are older than 20, we first need to identify which students are older than 20, using the Student table. After that, we will join this result with the Has_Pet table to count the number of pets owned by these students. We’ll use the `StuID` field from the Student table and the `Age` field for the condition, as requested.

Here’s the SQL query to get the result:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query does the following:

1. Filters the students who are older than 20 (WHERE Student.Age > 20).
2. Joins the filtered result with the Has_Pet table using the StuID key to get the matching records.
3. Counts the distinct number of PetID entries (as there could be multiple records for the same pet if it is owned jointly by more than one student).
4. Returns the count as NumberOfPets which represents the number of unique pets owned by students older than 20.

WHERE S.Sex = 'F' AND P.PetType = 'Dog';
```

This query performs the following operations:
- Joins the "Student" table with the "Has_Pet" table where the student IDs match.
- Joins the result of the above join with the "Pets" table where the pet IDs match.
- Filters the combined result set to include only female students (sex 'F') and dogs (pet type 'Dog').
- Counts the number of distinct pet IDs that meet the criteria.

This will give you the number of dogs that are raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of countries per continent, you can use a `COUNT` aggregation on the `countries` table and group by the continent. You then need to join this with the `continents` table to get the continent names. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents c
LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY c.ContId;
```

This query will produce a list with the Continent ID (`ContId`), Continent Name (`Continent`), and the number of countries in each continent (`NumberOfCountries`). The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that you still get continents listed even if they have no countries associated with them in the `countries` table, with `0` as the count in such cases.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of models each car maker produces, including the `Maker` full name and `Id`, we would need to perform a JOIN operation between the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables, and then perform an aggregate function (COUNT) to count the models grouped by each car maker. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.FullName, 
    cm.Id, 
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels 
FROM 
    car_makers AS cm 
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list AS ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker 
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id;
```

This query does the following:

- Selects the full name and id of the car maker from the `car_makers` table, aliased as `cm`.
- Left joins the `model_list` table (aliased as `ml`) on the `car_makers` Id being equal to the `model_list` Maker.
- Groups the results by the `Id` of the `car_makers`.
- Counts the number of models (`ModelId`) per group to find out how many models each car maker produces.
- The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a car maker has no models, it will still be included in the result with a count of 0.

Please note that the table `car_makers` uses "Country" (TEXT) as a reference to `countries(CountryId)`, which might not work unless the "Country" field in car_makers matches exactly to the INTEGER "CountryId" in countries, which is unusual for referential integrity. If this is an error and should instead match against a country name or be an INTEGER referencing the "CountryId", this would typically require a schema change for proper referential integrity.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 354
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, you should write a SQL query that joins the tables "car_makers" and "model_list" to count the number of models each car maker produces. Here's the SQL query that would give you the desired information:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.ModelId) as ModelCount
FROM car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query selects the `Id` and `FullName` from the "car_makers" table and counts the `ModelId` from the "model_list" table. It groups the results by `Id` and `FullName` from the "car_makers" table to ensure the count is accurate for each car maker. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a car maker does not have any models, it will still appear in the result with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 346
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we need to deal with the fact that the "horsepower" column is of type TEXT. Assuming that the column contains numeric values stored as text, we will need to convert the values to a numeric type to perform the minimum calculation.

Here's the SQL query to get the model with the minimum horsepower:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id, MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) as MinHorsepower
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'NA' AND TRIM(cd.Horsepower) != '' -- Exclude non-numeric or empty values
GROUP BY cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query first excludes any non-numeric or empty 'horsepower' values, then casts the horsepower strings to integers. It groups the results by model and make id (because the question suggests there could be different makes for the same model, which reflects that it would be necessary to differentiate them), then orders by the converted horsepower in ascending order and limits the results to just the one with the minimum horsepower.

Please notice that in real scenarios, having non-numeric or placeholder values like 'NA' in a column that should be numeric may indicate that the database design could be improved by storing these values as NULL or by using appropriate numeric types. Additionally, if there is variability in how 'NA' or empty strings are represented, the WHERE clause should be adjusted to account for those variations.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 349
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to join the "car_names" table with the "cars_data" table on their primary key (MakeId for "car_names" and Id for "cars_data") since the "Year" information is stored in the "cars_data" table. Here is the appropriate SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return the unique names of car models produced after the year 1980. Note that we used `DISTINCT` to ensure that each model is listed only once in the results even if multiple rows exist for the same model (which could happen if, for example, the model was produced in multiple different years, each with separate entries in the database).
