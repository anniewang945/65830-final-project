PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the different countries with singers above age 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this request, we need to retrieve a list of distinct countries from the `singer` table where the age of the singers is above 20. Here is the SQL query for this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Age" > 20;
```

This query selects only unique country names where the age condition (greater than 20) is met. The `DISTINCT` keyword helps eliminate any duplicate entries, giving us a list of different countries as requested.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we first need to calculate the average age of all singers. Then, we can filter for singers who are older than the average age. Once we have this list of singers, we can retrieve their song names.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query performs the following operations:

- The subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` calculates the average age of all singers in the singer table.
- The main query selects the column `Song_Name` from the singer table but only for those entries where the age of the singer (`s.Age`) is greater than the average age computed by the subquery.

This will give you a list of song names by singers who are above the average age.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 662
MODEL'S ANSWER: To obtain the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we must first count the number of concerts held in each stadium from 2014 onwards. Then we need to find the stadium with the maximum count.

Here are the steps we'll take in our query:
1. Join the `concert` and `stadium` tables on `Stadium_ID` to link concert data with stadium data.
2. Filter records in the `concert` table to consider only concerts from the year 2014 or later.
3. Group the results by `Stadium_ID` (and `Name` and `Capacity` from the `stadium` table) to be able to count the number of concerts per stadium.
4. Order the results by the count of concerts in descending order to have the stadium with the most concerts at the top.
5. Select the top row to find the stadium with the most concerts.

Let's write the SQL query based on these steps:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  s.Capacity
FROM
  stadium s
INNER JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY
  s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the name and capacity of the stadium that hosted the most number of concerts from the year 2014 onwards. We use `LIMIT 1` to ensure we get only the top stadium. If there are stadiums with the same maximum number of concerts, you will get one of them, as SQL does not have a standard way to handle ties in "top N" type queries without additional criteria.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums without any concerts, we need to look for stadiums for which there are no corresponding entries in the concert table. We can achieve this by performing a LEFT JOIN from the stadium table to the concert table, and then checking for NULLs in the stadium ID field from the concert table, because a NULL value would indicate that there was no match (i.e., no concert was held in that stadium). Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query selects the Name from the stadium table (`s`) and left joins it with the concert table (`c`) on the Stadium_ID. It then filters for records where there is no concert_ID in the concert table (c.concert_ID IS NULL), indicating no concert was held at the corresponding stadium.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, you would need to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the number of singers for each concert and then group the results by the concert's ID. Here is the SQL query that performs this operation:

```sql

LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID;
```

This query does the following:

- Selects the `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table (`c` being an alias for the table).
- Counts the number of `Singer_ID` entries from the `singer_in_concert` table (`sic` being an alias for the table) for each concert.
- Uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include all concerts even if they have no singers associated with them. The count for these concerts would be 0.
- Groups the results by `concert_ID` to ensure that the singers are counted for each individual concert.
- The result set will display each concert's name and theme, along with the number of singers that performed in that concert.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names and the number of concerts for each singer, we need to join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and then perform a group by on the Singer_ID to count the number of concerts for each singer. The SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name AS Singer_Name,
  COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Number_of_Concerts
FROM
  singer s
JOIN
  singer_in_concert sic
ON
  s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
  s.Singer_ID;
```

This query will give you each singer's name and the total number of concerts they have performed in. It assumes that a singer can perform in multiple concerts. If there's any singer who hasn't performed in any concert, they will not be listed in this result set, because the join will only match singers who have entries in the `singer_in_concert` table. If you also want to include singers who have never performed in a concert, you would need to use a `LEFT JOIN` and handle possible NULL values.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 668
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we will query the `singer` table and filter based on the `Song_Name` column. Here is the SQL query for the request:

```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Song_Name" LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query uses the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `%Hey%` to match any song name that includes the word 'Hey', regardless of what comes before or after it in the title. The percent signs (`%`) are wildcard characters that match zero or more characters in the pattern.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 454
MODEL'S ANSWER: To determine the number of pets owned by students over the age of 20, you need to combine information from the `Student` and `Has_Pet` tables. You can do this using a SQL `JOIN` statement. Given that a student may own more than one pet, you will need to use a `COUNT` aggregation to count the total number of pets after joining the tables and apply a `WHERE` clause to filter students by age. Here's the SQL query that would provide the required information:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This SQL statement does the following:
1. Joins the `Student` table and the `Has_Pet` table on the `StuID` column.
2. Filters the results to only include students who are over the age of 20.
3. Counts the distinct `PetID` values to ensure we only count each pet once, even if it appears more than once due to the same student owning multiple pets.
4. Returns the total count as `NumberOfPets`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 456
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, we need to perform a join between the `Student` table and the `Has_Pet` table, then join the result with the `Pets` table, and apply the filtering conditions accordingly. The specific steps are:

1. Select from the `Student` table only those students who are female (where `Sex` is 'F').
2. Join the `Has_Pet` table to find the pets that are owned by these female students.
3. Join the `Pets` table to find only those pets that are dogs.
4. Count the number of dogs.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student
INNER JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
INNER JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
WHERE Student.Sex = 'F' AND Pets.PetType = 'Dog';
```

This query counts the number of rows that satisfy the conditions of being a dog ('Dog' in the `PetType` column) and owned by a female student ('F' in the `Sex` column). The `INNER JOIN` operations ensure only the matching records from each table are selected for the final count.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of countries in each continent, we can perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `continents` and `countries` tables, and then use a `GROUP BY` statement along with the `COUNT` aggregate function. Here's the SQL query to do this:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent,
    COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents AS c
LEFT JOIN countries AS co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY c.ContId;
```

This query does the following:
- Selects the continent ID and the continent name from the `continents` table.
- Performs a left join to count how many times a continent ID appears in the `countries` table, which signifies the number of countries in each continent.
- Groups the result by continent ID and continent name to ensure that the count is done per each distinct continent.
- Orders the result by the continent ID for better readability.

The `COUNT(co.CountryId)` function counts the number of country IDs (i.e., the number of countries) for each continent. Since we used a LEFT JOIN, if there are no countries for a particular continent, it will still show up in the result with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker along with its ID and the count of how many models it produces, you need to join the `car_makers` table to the `model_list` table on the car maker's ID, and then group the results by the car maker's attributes, while counting the number of associated models. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This SQL query retrieves three columns: `Id` and `FullName` from the car makers table (`car_makers`), and a count of how many times each car maker's ID appears in the model list table (`model_list`). It uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that if a car maker doesn't have any models, it will still show up in the results with a count of zero (`0`).

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 861
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we will need to join the tables car_names and cars_data, as the horsepower is stored in cars_data and the model information is stored in car_names. Since the horsepower in this schema is stored as TEXT, we need to convert it to an INTEGER or REAL to compare the values numerically. We also need to manage cases where horsepower may not be a valid number (this can happen if there are records with non-numeric values, such as null or 'NA').

Here's the query to find the model with the minimum horsepower, taking the above into consideration:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names AS cn
JOIN cars_data AS cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'NA'
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)
LIMIT 1;
```

This query:

1. Joins the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables on their `MakeId` and `Id` columns respectively.
2. Filters out records where `Horsepower` is 'NA', which we are assuming represents a non-numeric value.
3. Orders the results by the `Horsepower` values cast from TEXT to INTEGER, in ascending order.
4. Limits the results to just the first row, which will have the minimum numeric horsepower.

If there are missing or incorrect values for horsepower that are not represented as 'NA', those will need to be handled possibly with additional WHERE clause conditions. Additionally, if there are multiple cars with the same minimum horsepower, this query will return only one of them. If you need all cars with the minimum horsepower, you would need to use a subquery to find the minimum horsepower value first and then select all models with that horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 863
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models that were produced after 1980, we need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table on their respective `MakeId` and `Id` columns, and then select distinct `Model` values where the `Year` is greater than 1980. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return a list of distinct models from the `car_names` table for which the corresponding entry in the `cars_data` table has a `Year` value greater than 1980.
