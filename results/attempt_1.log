PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 805
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `stadium`, and `concert` tables based on the `Stadium_ID` column and count the number of concerts hosted at each stadium for the specified years. Then we need to order the results by the count in descending order and select the top record using a subquery or a LIMIT clause. Here is the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  s.Capacity
FROM
  stadium s
JOIN
  concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY
  s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `stadium` and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID`, filtering for concerts held in 2014 or later. It groups the results by `Stadium_ID` and orders them by the count of concert IDs in each group, from highest to lowest. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result (stadium with the most concerts) is returned.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .

Your SQL query should use columns concert_name, theme, and concert_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 802
MODEL'S ANSWER: To show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert, we can write a query that joins the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and uses an aggregate function (`COUNT`) to count the number of singers for each concert. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name, 
    c.Theme, 
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) as Number_of_Singers
FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic 
ON 
    c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID;
```

This query performs the following actions:
- Selects the `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table, aliased as `c`.
- Uses a LEFT JOIN to include all concerts, even those without any singers, by joining on the `concert_ID` field from both tables.
- Counts the number of `Singer_ID` from the `singer_in_concert` table for each concert using the `COUNT` aggregate function, labeled as `Number_of_Singers`.
- Groups the results by `concert_ID` to make sure the count is accurate for each individual concert.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .

Your SQL query should use columns name and singer_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 792
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts they've performed in, we need to join the tables `singer` and `singer_in_concert`, and then count the number of concerts per singer. Here's the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, COUNT(sc.concert_ID) as Number_of_Concerts
FROM singer s
JOIN singer_in_concert sc ON s.Singer_ID = sc.Singer_ID
GROUP BY s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query will return a list of singers along with the total number of concerts they have participated in. The `JOIN` operation is done on the common `Singer_ID` field between the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to aggregate the results by singer's details. The `COUNT` function is then used to determine the number of concerts each singer has been involved with.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?

Your SQL query should use columns name, country, and song_name.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 809
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we can perform a `SELECT` query on the `singer` table, filtering the records where the `Song_Name` includes the word 'Hey'. We can make the search case-insensitive by using the `ILIKE` keyword in PostgreSQL which performs a case-insensitive pattern match. Here's what the query would look like:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name ILIKE '%Hey%';
```

This will return all singers whose song's name contains 'Hey', regardless of case (hey, Hey, HEY, etc.).

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?

Your SQL query should use colums stuid and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 547
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students older than 20, we can use a JOIN between the Student and Has_Pet tables to get the list of pets corresponding to students who meet the age criteria. Then, we'll COUNT the distinct PetID entries. Here is the SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) AS NumberOfPetsOwnedByStudentsOver20
FROM Student AS s
JOIN Has_Pet AS hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
WHERE s.Age > 20;
```

This query joins the Student table with Has_Pet on the student ID, filters students with an age greater than 20, and then counts the unique pet IDs associated with these students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of countries in each continent, we'll perform a `COUNT` aggregate function on countries for each continent, joining the `continents` and `countries` tables based on their relationship. We will group the results by the continent to get the count for each.

Here is the SQL query you need:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(r.CountryId) as NumberOfCountries
FROM continents c
LEFT JOIN countries r ON c.ContId = r.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent;
```

This query:
- Selects the `ContId` and `Continent` from the `continents` table.
- Joins the `countries` table as `r` with the `continents` table on the `ContId` and `Continent`.
- Counts the `CountryId` from the `countries` table for each continent.
- Groups the results by `ContId` and `Continent` to ensure that counts are done per continent.
- The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if there are continents with no countries, they will still show up in the result with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: To calculate how many models each car maker produces, we will need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on their respective IDs to map each model to its maker. Then we group by the car maker and count the number of models for each maker. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.FullName,
    cm.Id,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName
ORDER BY 
    cm.Id;
```

This query will return a list that includes the full name of each car maker (retrieved from the `FullName` column in `car_makers`), the maker's identifier (from the `Id` column in `car_makers`), and the count of models (from the `ModelId` column in `model_list`), grouped for each maker. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures the results are ordered by the car maker ID.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1025
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out which model of the car has the minimum horsepower, we will have to join the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables using the `MakeId` from `car_names` and `Id` from `cars_data`. We will then use the `MIN` aggregate function to get the minimum horsepower while filtering for rows with non-empty horsepower values. Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id, MIN(cd.Horsepower) AS MinHorsepower
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> '' -- excluding the empty horsepower values
GROUP BY cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the model of the car with the minimum horsepower value. Note that we are also filtering out any rows where the horsepower is an empty string, as the horsepower should be a numerical value. We use `ORDER BY` to arrange the results in ascending order based on horsepower and `LIMIT 1` to get only the first entry, which will be the model with the lowest horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1028
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we will need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table because the `car_names` table contains the model names, and the `cars_data` table contains the year in which the car make was created. The `MakeId` from `car_names` and `Id` from `cars_data` are the keys to join them.

The following SQL query will retrieve the distinct models produced after 1980:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query selects distinct values from the `Model` column of the `car_names` (aliased as `cn`) table. It joins the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` (aliased as `cd`) table on their respective IDs and filters the results to include only those car makes with a `Year` value greater than 1980.
