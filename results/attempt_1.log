SELECT singer.Song_Name
FROM singer
WHERE singer.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
``` 

This query calculates the average age by selecting the average of the Age column from the singer table and then compares each singer's age against this average to determine if they are above the average age. Only the song names of these singers are then returned.

1. concert.stadium_id
2. concert.year
3. stadium.stadium_id
4. stadium.name
5. stadium.capacity

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 848
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to count the number of concerts per stadium for the specified year range and then identify the stadium with the maximum count. Here's the query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
  st.Name AS StadiumName,
  st.Capacity
FROM 
  stadium st
JOIN 
  concert c ON st.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE 
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY 
  st.Stadium_ID, st.Name, st.Capacity
ORDER BY 
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `stadium` and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID` columns. It filters concerts that took place in 2014 or later with the `WHERE` clause, then groups the results by `Stadium_ID` to count the number of concerts per stadium. It orders the grouped results by the count in descending order, ensuring the stadium with the most concerts comes first. Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause will return only the top result, which is the stadium with the highest count.

GROUP BY 
    c.concert_id;
```

This query lists all concerts with their names and themes, and the number of singers in each concert. It uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that concerts without any singers are also included in the results, showing 0 for the number of singers in such cases. The COUNT() function is applied to singers to get the number of appearances in the singer_in_concert table, which is grouped by the concert ID.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. singer.name
2. singer.singer_id
3. singer_in_concert.singer_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 833
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts for each singer, we need to join the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables on `singer_id`, and then use the `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of concerts for each singer. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name as singer_name,
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) as number_of_concerts
FROM 
    singer s
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic
ON 
    s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
    s.Name;
```

In this query:
- We select the `Name` from the `singer` table, aliasing it as `singer_name`.
- We count the `concert_ID` from the `singer_in_concert` table for each singer and alias the count as `number_of_concerts`.
- We use a LEFT JOIN between `singer` and `singer_in_concert` on their `Singer_ID` columns since we want to include singers who may not have performed in any concert at all (the count for them will be 0).
- We group the results by the `Name` of the singer to ensure the count is done per singer.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. student.stuid
2. student.sex
3. has_pet.stuid
4. has_pet.petid

6. pets.pettype

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 604
MODEL'S ANSWER: You can find the number of dog pets raised by female students by joining the three tables you've provided and then counting the distinct pet IDs of those pets that are dogs. The following SQL query should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pets.PetID) as NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
WHERE Student.Sex = 'F'
AND Pets.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table based on the `StuID` column to associate students with their pets.
- Further joins the `Has_Pet` table with the `Pets` table based on the `PetID` column to get information about the pets.
- Filters the results to include only female students (`WHERE Student.Sex = 'F'`).
- Filters the results to include only pets that are dogs (`WHERE Pets.PetType = 'dog'`).
- Counts the number of distinct `PetID`s that meet the criteria (the `COUNT(DISTINCT pets.PetID)` part of the SELECT statement). This count gives us the number of dog pets owned by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. continents.contid
2. continents.continent
3. countries.continent
SQL:  select t1.contid ,  t1.continent ,  count(*) from continents as t1 
join countries as t2 on t1.contid  =  t2.continent group by t1.contid;
Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1127
MODEL'S ANSWER: The query provided is mostly correct, but to list the continent name along with the continent id and the number of countries, we also need to include `t1.continent` in the `GROUP BY` clause. The modified query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
  t1.ContId, 
  t1.Continent, 
  COUNT(*) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents t1
JOIN countries t2 ON t1.ContId = t2.Continent
GROUP BY t1.ContId, t1.Continent;
```

This query joins the continents table (aliased as t1) to the countries table (aliased as t2) on their respective continent identifiers. It then groups the results by the continent id and continent name, and uses the `COUNT(*)` function to calculate the number of countries in each continent. The `AS NumberOfCountries` gives a label to the count output, making the result clearer.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1070
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, we can perform a JOIN operation between the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables and count the number of models for each maker. The resulting query should group the results by the car maker's `id` and `fullname`. Here is the query to obtain the requested list:

```sql
SELECT 
    car_makers.Id, 
    car_makers.FullName,
    COUNT(model_list.Maker) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers
JOIN 
    model_list 
ON 
    car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
    car_makers.Id, 
    car_makers.FullName;
```

This query joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table where the `Id` from `car_makers` matches the `Maker` from `model_list`. It then counts the number of models associated with each maker and groups the results by the maker's `Id` and `FullName`.

1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker, along with its id and how many models it produces, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and count the number of models for each car maker. Here's the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql

JOIN 
    model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
    car_makers.Id, car_makers.FullName;
```

This query joins the two tables on the `car_makers.Id` field to the `model_list.Maker` field, counts the number of models belonging to each maker by using the `COUNT()` function and groups the results by the car maker's id and full name so that we get the total count of models for each car maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_names.model
2. car_names.makeid
3. cars_data.id
4. cars_data.horsepower

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1066
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we would need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table on their common column which is `makeid` for `car_names` and `id` for `cars_data`. We want the minimum value, so we'll use the `MIN` aggregate function on `cars_data.horsepower`, and we also need to consider only non-null and numeric values for horsepower since the `horsepower` column is of type TEXT. Here's the query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT car_names.model
FROM car_names
JOIN cars_data ON car_names.makeid = cars_data.id
WHERE cars_data.horsepower NOT LIKE 'null'
ORDER BY CAST(cars_data.horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC
LIMIT 1;
``` 

This query orders the joined table by the horsepower after casting the horsepower to an INTEGER and filtering out any rows where the horsepower is 'null'. It then limits the result to just the first row, which would have the smallest horsepower value.

2. car_names.model
3. car_names.makeid
4. cars_data.id
5. cars_data.year

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to use the `model_list`, `car_names`, and `cars_data` tables. We can join these tables on appropriate keys (`model_list.Model` with `car_names.Model` and `car_names.MakeId` with `cars_data.Id`) and use the `DISTINCT` keyword to select only distinct models. We then apply the condition to filter out the cars by year (`cars_data.Year > 1980`). 

Here's the SQL query that executes this operation:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ml.Model
FROM model_list ml
JOIN car_names cn ON ml.Model = cn.Model
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return a list of unique car models from the database that were produced after the year 1980.
