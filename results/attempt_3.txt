1. singer.country
2. singer.age

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 307
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find all distinct countries where singers above age 20 are from, we can use a simple SELECT statement with the DISTINCT keyword to ensure we are listing unique countries. We will also include a WHERE clause to filter out singers who are 20 years old or younger.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT singer.Country
FROM singer
WHERE singer.Age > 20;
```

This query selects all unique country names from the `singer` table where the age of the singer is greater than 20.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 305
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the different countries with singers above the age of 20, you would use the DISTINCT keyword to select unique country names from the singer table, where the age of the singers is greater than 20. The SQL query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.country
FROM singer s
WHERE s.age > 20;
```

This query checks the age column of each singer and ensures that only countries with singers above the age of 20 are included in the results. The DISTINCT keyword makes sure each country is only listed once, regardless of how many singers it may have that meet the criteria.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 331
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in 2014 or after, we can use a combination of the `concert` and `stadium` tables. Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name,
    s.Capacity
FROM
    stadium s
JOIN
    (SELECT 
        c.Stadium_ID,
        COUNT(*) AS NumberOfConcerts

     ORDER BY 
        NumberOfConcerts DESC
     LIMIT 1) AS subquery
ON 
    s.Stadium_ID = subquery.Stadium_ID;
```

This query executes the following steps:

1. It selects records from the `concert` table where the `Year` is 2014 or later.
2. It then groups the results by `Stadium_ID` and counts the number of concerts for each stadium.
3. The subquery orders the stadiums by the count of concerts in descending order to find the stadium with the most concerts, and limits the result to just the top one.
4. The outer query joins the result of the subquery with the `stadium` table to get the stadium name and capacity corresponding to the `Stadium_ID` with the most concerts.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 313
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of all stadiums that have not been used for any concerts, you would need to do a LEFT JOIN between the "stadium" and "concert" tables, and look for records where there is no corresponding "concert.stadium_id". Here is the SQL query for the same:

```sql
SELECT stadium.Name

LEFT JOIN concert ON stadium.Stadium_ID = concert.Stadium_ID
WHERE concert.Stadium_ID IS NULL;
```

This query joins the two tables on their "Stadium_ID" fields, and filters for those rows where "concert.Stadium_ID" is NULL, which indicates that there are no concerts associated with that particular stadium.

2. concert.concert_name
3. concert.theme
4. concert.concert_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 329
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill the request, you can write a SQL query that performs a JOIN between the "concert" and "singer_in_concert" tables, and then use the COUNT aggregate function to get the number of singers for each concert. The query will need to group the results by the concert ID, name, and theme to get the correct count per concert.

Here is the query you can use:

```sql
SELECT
    c.concert_Name as Name,
    c.Theme,
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) as Number_of_Singers
FROM
    concert c
LEFT JOIN
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY
    c.concert_ID,
    c.concert_Name,
    c.Theme;
```

This query performs the following actions:
- It selects the concert name and theme from the "concert" table.
- It left joins the "singer_in_concert" table on the concert ID to consider even those concerts where no singers might be associated.
- It uses COUNT to get the total number of singers associated with each concert by counting the number of Singer_IDs for each group.
- It groups the result set by the concert ID, name, and theme to ensure that the count of singers is accurate for each distinct concert.
- The use of LEFT JOIN ensures that even concerts without any singers will be shown in the result, with a count of zero.

2. student.age
3. has_pet.stuid

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 232
MODEL'S ANSWER: To count the number of pets owned by students over the age of 20, we'll need to perform a JOIN operation between the `Student` and `Has_Pet` tables using the `StuID` column that they both share. We then check the condition for the `Age` column in the `Student` table, and count the distinct pets by their `PetID`. Here's the SQL query you would use:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used before `Has_Pet.PetID` to ensure we count each pet once even if there happen to be multiple records for the same pet (though typically primary keys like PetID should be unique).

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. student.stuid
2. student.sex
3. has_pet.stuid
4. has_pet.petid
5. pets.petid
6. pets.pettype

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 253
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, you would need to join the three tables together (`Student`, `Has_Pet`, and `Pets`) and then count the number of records that fulfill the criteria: the `PetType` is 'dog' and the `Sex` is 'F'. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPetsByFemaleStudents
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
WHERE Student.Sex = 'F' AND Pets.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query joins the tables on their respective foreign key relationships, then filters the results to include only those records where the student is female and the pet type is 'dog'. The `COUNT(*)` function is then used to find the total number of records that match these criteria.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. continents.contid
2. continents.continent
3. countries.continent
SQL:  select t1.contid ,  t1.continent ,  count(*) from continents as t1 
join countries as t2 on t1.contid  =  t2.continent group by t1.contid;
Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 448
MODEL'S ANSWER: The list of columns provided suggests that we use `continents.contid` and `continents.continent` to display the results, and `countries.continent` to count the countries per continent. Below is the SQL query for the desired result:

```sql
SELECT continents.ContId, continents.Continent, COUNT(countries.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents
LEFT JOIN countries ON continents.ContId = countries.Continent
GROUP BY continents.ContId, continents.Continent;
```

In this query, we are selecting the `ContId` and `Continent` from the `continents` table. We are using a `LEFT JOIN` to bring in the `countries` table based on the relationship of `ContId` to `Continent`. We count the number of countries per continent (Countries with the same `Continent` foreign key value). We use `GROUP BY` on `continents.ContId` and `continents.Continent` to ensure we group the results by continent, with each continent presented only once in the result set. Notice that we're also using the column `countries.CountryId` in the `COUNT` function because this ensures we're counting rows that have a valid country (non-null CountryId). 

The use of `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a continent has no countries associated with it in the `countries` table, it will still show up in the result with a count of zero. If you're sure that every continent has at least one country and you want only continents with countries, you could use an `INNER JOIN` instead. However, in most cases, using a `LEFT JOIN` here is safer and ensures all continents are accounted for in the results.

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 391
MODEL'S ANSWER: To calculate how many models each car maker produces, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table using the `Id` field from `car_makers` and the `Maker` field from `model_list`. We will then group the results by the maker's `Id` and `FullName` to count the number of models associated with each maker. Here is the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    car_makers.Id, 
    car_makers.FullName,

FROM

JOIN 
    model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
    car_makers.Id, 
    car_makers.FullName;
```

This query will list each car maker along with their `Id`, `FullName` and the number of models they produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 393
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out the full name of each car maker along with its id and the number of models it produces, we'll need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on their respective maker-related columns. We will then count the number of models produced by each car maker.

Here's the SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT
  car_makers.Id AS MakerId,
  car_makers.FullName,
  COUNT(model_list.ModelId) AS ModelCount
FROM car_makers
LEFT JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY car_makers.Id, car_makers.FullName;
```

This query uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that we include all car makers in the output, even if some of them do not have any models associated with them (in which case, `ModelCount` would be 0 for those makers). We use `GROUP BY` to group results by car maker, and we count the number of model IDs associated with each car maker to get the number of models for each.

2. car_names.makeid
3. cars_data.id
4. cars_data.horsepower

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 387
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we can write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
INNER JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA'
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation:
1. We join `car_names` (`cn`) with `cars_data` (`cd`) on the `MakeId` and `Id` fields to correlate the model names with horsepower values.
2. We include a WHERE clause to filter out any records where Horsepower is not available (`'NA'`), as we cannot compare non-numeric values.
3. We order the results by the `Horsepower` after casting it to INTEGER (assuming that Horsepower is stored as TEXT) in ascending order to find the smallest horsepower first.
4. We limit the result to one row to get only the model with the minimum horsepower.
