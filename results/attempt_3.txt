PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .

Your SQL query should use columns song_name and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 275
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, you'll have to join the "singer" table with a subquery that calculates the average age. You can use the `AVG()` aggregate function to calculate the average age, and then compare each singer's age to this average. Here's the SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (
    SELECT AVG(Age) 
    FROM singer
);
```

This query retrieves the names and song names of singers whose age is greater than the average age of all singers in the "singer" table. The subquery calculates the average age, and the main query uses it to filter the results.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 288
MODEL'S ANSWER: To show the stadium name and capacity that has hosted the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we will need to join the tables `stadium` and `concert` based on `Stadium_ID`. Then, we'll count the number of concerts for each stadium within the specified year range (2014 or after). Finally, we'll select the stadium with the maximum count. Here is the SQL query for this request:

```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    s.Capacity
FROM
    stadium s
JOIN
    concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
    CAST(c.Year AS INT) >= 2014
GROUP BY
    s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY
    COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `stadium` and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID` column, filters the concerts to ones in the year 2014 or after by casting the `Year` text column into an integer for comparison, groups the result by `Stadium_ID` (as well as its name and capacity for the selection), orders the stadiums by the descending count of the number of concerts, and limits the results to the very top entry (the stadium with the most concerts).

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .

Your SQL query should use columns concert_name, theme, and concert_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 285
MODEL'S ANSWER: To accomplish this, you would need to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table, group the results by concert, and then count the number of singers for each concert. Here's the SQL query to do so:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.concert_Name,
  c.Theme,
  COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) AS NumberOfSingers
FROM 
  concert c
LEFT JOIN 
  singer_in_concert sic
ON 
  c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
  c.concert_ID, c.concert_Name, c.Theme;
```

Explanation:
- `c` is the alias for the `concert` table, and `sic` is the alias for the `singer_in_concert` table.
- The `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that you include all concerts even if they do not have any singers associated with them.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by their concert details.
- The `COUNT(sic.Singer_ID)` function calculates the number of singers in each concert.

Note: In the `singer_in_concert` table schema, the `Singer_ID` column is of type text, which is a bit unusual since it's a foreign key that should normally be an integer to match the primary key type of the `singer` table. In a proper relational database design, the `Singer_ID` should be an int to correspond with the `Singer_ID` in the `singer` table. If this is an oversight, it should be corrected to maintain data integrity and improve query performance.

Your SQL query should use colums stuid and age.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 196
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of pets owned by students over the age of 20, we need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table based on the `StuID` to filter out students with `Age` greater than 20 and then count the distinct pets associated with these students.

This SQL query will return the count of unique pet IDs linked to students whose age is greater than 20. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that if a student has more than one record in the `Has_Pet` table for the same pet (unlikely in a well-structured database, but possible due to data duplication), that pet is only counted once.

- Joins the `Has_Pet` and `Pets` tables on `PetID`.
- Filters the results to only include records where the student is female (`Sex = 'F'`) and the pet is a dog (`PetType = 'dog'`).
- Counts the distinct `PetID` values to ensure that each dog pet is only counted once, even if it appears in the relationship table `Has_Pet` multiple times for some reason.

Remember to adjust the column `PetType` value if necessary, in case the type of pets people have is stored differently in your database (e.g., 'Dog' instead of 'dog').

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out the number of countries in each continent, we need to perform a count on "countries" for each continent, then join that result with the "continents" table to include continent names. Here's the SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(co.CountryId) as NumberOfCountries
FROM continents as c
LEFT JOIN countries as co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent;
```

This query performs the following operations:

1. It selects the `ContId` and `Continent` columns from the `continents` table.

2. It performs a `LEFT JOIN` with the `countries` table on the `Continent` column to match countries to their continents.

3. It then groups the results by `ContId` and `Continent` to ensure the count is specific to each continent.

4. The `COUNT(co.CountryId)` function is used to count the number of countries in each group (i.e., each continent).

5. The result of the count is given an alias `NumberOfCountries`. 

This will give you a list with the continent id, the continent name, and the number of countries within each continent. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all continents are listed, even if they have zero countries in the `countries` table.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 352
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the number of models each car maker produces along with the maker's full name and ID, we can write a SQL query that joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and groups the results by the car maker. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.FullName,
    cm.Id,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml 
ON 
    cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id
ORDER BY 
    cm.FullName;
```

This query does the following:

1. Joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on the `Id` (maker ID) column.
2. Counts the number of models (`ModelId`) associated with each maker.
3. Uses `GROUP BY` to aggregate results by car maker `Id`.
4. Selects the `FullName` and `Id` from the `car_makers` table, and the resulting count of models as `NumberOfModels`.
5. Orders the results by the `FullName` of the car maker for easier readability.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 354
MODEL'S ANSWER: To determine the full name of each car maker along with its ID and the number of models it produces, you need to perform a JOIN operation between `car_makers` and `model_list` based on the maker ID, and then aggregate the number of models per maker. After that, we group by the maker ID and their full names. Here is how you can write the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) as NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query does the following:

- Selects the maker's ID `Id`, the maker's full name `FullName`, and counts the number of models per maker `COUNT(ml.ModelId)`.
- Performs a LEFT JOIN between `car_makers` (aliased as `cm`) and `model_list` (aliased as `ml`) on their respective maker IDs.
- Groups the results by the maker's ID `Id` and full name `FullName` to ensure that we get unique entries for each car maker.
- Outputs the full name and ID of each car maker, along with the count of models it produces, as a new column `NumberOfModels`.

This query will return a list of all car makers even if they have no associated models, because it uses a LEFT JOIN, which includes all rows from the `car_makers` table and the matching rows from the `model_list`, giving `NULL` in columns from `model_list` if there is no match. The `COUNT` function counts the number of non-NULL `ModelId` entries, effectively giving the number of models for each maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 346
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, you need to first join the necessary tables so you can refer to the 'model' and 'horsepower' columns together. Then, you can order by 'horsepower' and select the model with the minimum horsepower. However, the 'horsepower' column is of TEXT datatype, which cannot be directly used for ordering numerically. Thus, we need to change the TEXT to INTEGER for proper comparison.

Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id, cd.Horsepower
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA'
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower as INTEGER)
LIMIT 1;
```

This query is assuming that 'Horsepower' may have some non-numeric values, such as 'NA' (which is common for missing data in some datasets). The `WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA'` clause filters out these non-numeric values, and `CAST(cd.Horsepower as INTEGER)` converts the valid 'Horsepower' values into integers so that they can be compared numerically. Finally, we order by this converted 'Horsepower' in ascending order and limit the results to the first row to get the minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 349
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find distinct car models produced after 1980, you should join the tables "car_names" and "cars_data" because you need to match the model names (from "car_names") with their respective years of production (from "cars_data"). We are particularly interested in "Model", "MakeId" from "car_names" and "Id", "Year" from "cars_data". Here's the query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
INNER JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query performs an inner join operation between the "car_names" table (aliased as "cn") and the "cars_data" table (aliased as "cd"), matching rows where "MakeId" from "car_names" equals "Id" from "cars_data". The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those cars made after 1980, and `DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each car model is listed only once in the result set.
