The following paragraphs further describe the database.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station. Report the station ID, route ID, and distance (in miles) to the previous station, sorted by decreasing distance. Break ties in distance by sorting by route ID and then station ID, both in ascending order.
Your SQL query should use columns station_id, route_id, and distance_from_last_station_miles.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1310
MODEL'S ANSWER: Here is the SQL query to find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station alongside their station ID, route ID, and distance to the previous station, sorted in the order as requested:

```sql
SELECT station_id, route_id, distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM station_orders
WHERE distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1
ORDER BY distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, route_id ASC, station_id ASC;
```

This query selects the relevant columns from the `station_orders` table where the `distance_from_last_station_miles` is at least 1 mile, and orders the result first by distance in descending order, then by `route_id` and then by `station_id` in ascending order if there are ties in distance.

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find the first and last station for each route on each line. Report the line name, route direction name, and first and last station name. Sort the results by the line name, direction name, first station name, and then last station name, all in ascending order.

Your SQL query should use columns first_station_id, last_station_id, line_name, line_id, direction_desc, and station_name.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1313
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the first and last station for each route on each line, we need to join the `routes`, `stations`, and `lines` tables, using the `line_id` to match routes with lines and the `station_id` with the station names for first and last stations. Then, we can select the `line_name`, `direction_desc`, `first_station_id`, and `last_station_id`, but match the `station_id`s with the station names from the `stations` table for display purposes.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.line_name,
    r.direction_desc,
    sf.station_name AS first_station_name,
    sl.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM 
    routes r
JOIN 
    lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN 
    stations sf ON r.first_station_id = sf.station_id
JOIN 
    stations sl ON r.last_station_id = sl.station_id
ORDER BY 
    l.line_name ASC,
    r.direction_desc ASC,
    sf.station_name ASC,
    sl.station_name ASC;
```

This query performs an inner join between `routes` and `lines` on the `line_id`, then joins with the `stations` table twice: once to get the name of the first station (`sf` alias for first station) and once for the last station (`sl` alias for last station). Lastly, it orders the result set by the line name, route direction name, first station name, and then last station name in ascending order as requested.

PASSING USER PROMPT:Report the historical total_ons on weekdays between 4:00 PM and 6:30 PM per season for the "Kendall/MIT” Red Line station. Report the season, line ID, direction, and total_ons, sorted by the season and direction in ascending order.

Your SQL query should use columns time_period_id, period_start_time, period_end_time, station_id, station_name, season, line_id, direction, and total_ons.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1325
MODEL'S ANSWER: To generate a report of the historical `total_ons` on weekdays between 4:00 PM and 6:30 PM per season for the "Kendall/MIT" Red Line station, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the `time_period_id` that corresponds to weekdays between 4:00 PM and 6:30 PM from the `time_periods` table.
2. Find the `station_id` that corresponds to the "Kendall/MIT" station from the `stations` table.
3. Use the `time_period_id` and `station_id` to filter the `rail_ridership` table for the total ons.
4. Extract the desired columns (`season`, `line_id`, `direction`, `total_ons`) and sort the results by `season` and `direction` in ascending order.

Here is the SQL query that fulfills these requirements:

```sql
SELECT
    r.season,
    r.line_id,
    r.direction,
    r.total_ons
FROM
    rail_ridership r
JOIN
    stations s ON r.station_id = s.station_id
JOIN
    time_periods tp ON r.time_period_id = tp.time_period_id
WHERE
    s.station_name = 'Kendall/MIT' AND
    r.line_id = 'red' AND
    tp.day_type = 'weekday' AND
    tp.period_start_time >= '16:00:00' AND
    tp.period_end_time <= '18:30:00'
ORDER BY
    r.season ASC,
    r.direction ASC;
```

Please note, if the time periods between 4:00 PM and 6:30 PM are split across multiple rows in the `time_periods` table, you will need to adapt the query accordingly to include all relevant time period IDs. However, based on the example row, the time periods are denoted in larger chunks, so assuming there is a single row that includes the time frame from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM is reasonable for this query.

The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find the total length in miles and number of stations of each line’s routes. Report the route_id, direction, route_name, number of stations, and length in miles for each route. Exclude the Green Line since the distance between stations is missing. Sort the results by total number of stations in descending order (break tie using total length in miles in descending).

Your SQL query should use columns line_name, station_id, route_id, direction, route_name, distance_from_last_station_miles, and line_id, along with the COUNT and SUM aggregations functions.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1344
MODEL'S ANSWER: ```sql
SELECT 
    r.route_id,
    r.direction,
    r.route_name,
    COUNT(so.station_id) AS number_of_stations,
    SUM(so.distance_from_last_station_miles) AS length_in_miles
FROM 
    routes AS r
JOIN 
    station_orders AS so ON r.route_id = so.route_id
JOIN 
    lines AS l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
WHERE 
    l.line_name != 'Green Line' -- Exclude Green Line
GROUP BY 
    r.route_id,
    r.direction,
    r.route_name
ORDER BY 
    number_of_stations DESC, 
    length_in_miles DESC;
```

This SQL query joins the `routes`, `stations_orders`, and `lines` tables to calculate the total length in miles and the number of stations for each route. It filters out any routes belonging to the 'Green Line', groups the data by `route_id`, `direction`, and `route_name`, and orders the results based on the number of stations in descending order, breaking ties with the total length in miles, also in descending order. The `COUNT` and `SUM` aggregate functions help to do the calculation for the number of stations and length, respectively.

The following paragraphs further describe the database.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

PASSING USER PROMPT:For each station in each season, find the average number of line service days. (That is, find the average of the number of number_service_days over different lines, directions and time periods, but do not sum over different values for season.) Report the station name, season, and averaged number_service_days value, sorted by that average value in descending order. Break ties by sorting by season and then station name, both in ascending order.

Your SQL querys hould use columns station_name, season, number_service_days, station_id, along with the AVG aggregation function.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1346
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the average number of line service days for each station in each season, we'll need to group by the season and station_id. Then find the average of the number_service_days. Finally, we'll join the result with the stations table to get the station_name and sort the results as required. Here is the corresponding SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.station_name, 
    rr.season, 
    AVG(rr.number_service_days) AS averaged_service_days
FROM 
    rail_ridership rr
JOIN 
    stations s ON rr.station_id = s.station_id
GROUP BY 
    rr.season, 
    s.station_id, 
    s.station_name
ORDER BY 
    averaged_service_days DESC, 
    rr.season ASC, 
    s.station_name ASC;
```

This query joins the rail_ridership table with the stations table on their station_id. We use the AVG aggregation function to calculate the average number_service_days, and we group the results by season and station_id. We then proceed to order the results by the averaged number_service_days in descending order, with ties broken by season in ascending order, and then by station_name in ascending order.

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find the station(s) with the most gated entries over the summer of 2021 (June, July, August of 2021). Report the station name(s) and the number of gated entries.

Your SQL query should use station_name, gated_entries, service_date, and station_id, along with the MAX and SUM aggregation functions.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1299
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the station(s) with the most gated entries over the summer of 2021 (June, July, August), we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.station_name, SUM(gse.gated_entries) AS total_gated_entries
FROM gated_station_entries AS gse
JOIN stations AS s ON gse.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE gse.service_date >= '2021-06-01' AND gse.service_date <= '2021-08-31'
GROUP BY s.station_name
ORDER BY SUM(gse.gated_entries) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query sums all the gated entries grouped by station name, and then filters the service dates to only include summer months of 2021. It orders the stations by the total number of gated entries in descending order and limits the result to the station(s) with the maximum number of gated entries (the top station).

However, if there are stations with the same number of gated entries as the most entries, we will not get all of them. The above query will return only one station, regardless of whether there are ties. To get all stations sharing the maximum number of entries, we need a subquery to identify the maximum number of entries across all stations, then use this value to find all stations with gated entries equal to this maximum:

```sql
SELECT s.station_name, SUM(gse.gated_entries) AS total_gated_entries
FROM stations AS s
JOIN gated_station_entries AS gse ON s.station_id = gse.station_id
WHERE gse.service_date >= '2021-06-01' AND gse.service_date <= '2021-08-31'
GROUP BY s.station_name
HAVING SUM(gse.gated_entries) = (
    SELECT MAX(summed_entries) 
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(gated_entries) AS summed_entries
        FROM gated_station_entries
        WHERE service_date >= '2021-06-01' AND service_date <= '2021-08-31'
        GROUP BY station_id
    ) AS subquery
);
```

This query will report all station names with the most gated entries over the summer of 2021 by matching the sum of their gated entries with the maximum sum identified in the subquery.

Report the day_type, period_start time, season, line_id, station_name, and total_offs for this station.

Your SQL query should use day_type, period_start_time, season, line_id, station_name, total_offs, station_id, and time_period_id, along with the MAX aggregation function.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the station with the largest number of people who got off (total_offs), we can join the `rail_ridership` table with `stations`, `lines`, and `time_periods` to get all the necessary information. We can then use the MAX aggregate function to find the maximum total_offs along with its corresponding details. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    tp.day_type,
    tp.period_start_time,
    rr.season,
    rr.line_id,
    s.station_name,
    rr.total_offs
FROM rail_ridership rr
JOIN stations s ON rr.station_id = s.station_id
JOIN time_periods tp ON rr.time_period_id = tp.time_period_id
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        MAX(total_offs) AS max_offs
    FROM rail_ridership
) AS sub ON rr.total_offs = sub.max_offs
ORDER BY rr.total_offs DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Let's break down this query:

- We join the `rail_ridership` table with the `stations` table on their common `station_id` field, and with the `time_periods` table on their common `time_period_id` field.
- We create a subquery that selects the maximum total_offs from the `rail_ridership` table and give it an alias `max_offs`.
- We then join this subquery result with the main query on the `total_offs` field to get only the rows that match this maximum value.
- We use the `ORDER BY rr.total_offs DESC` to sort the result just in case there are ties with the same maximum value. This ensures we get the top result.
- We limit the result set to 1 to get the single record with the largest total_offs.

Please note if there are multiple stations with the same maximum number of people getting off, this query will return only one of those stations. Also, since `total_offs` may have ties, if you need to get all tied records, you will need to remove the `LIMIT 1` part from the query.

The following paragraphs further describe the database.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

Your SQL query should use columns station_name, total_ons, station_id, line_id, season, line_name, time_period_id, and direction.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1347
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the required information, we first need to find the average `total_ons` for all Orange Line stations during `time_period_01` in Fall 2018, in direction 0. Then, we filter out the stations that have a `total_ons` value greater than this average. Below is the query to perform these operations:

```sql
WITH orange_line_2018_avg AS (
  SELECT 
    AVG(rr.total_ons) as avg_total_ons
  FROM 
    rail_ridership rr
  JOIN 
    lines ln ON rr.line_id = ln.line_id
  WHERE 
    rr.season = 'Fall 2018' AND
    rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01' AND
    rr.direction = 0 AND
    ln.line_name = 'Orange Line'
)
SELECT 
  st.station_name, 
  rr.total_ons
FROM 
  rail_ridership rr
JOIN 
  stations st ON rr.station_id = st.station_id
JOIN 
  lines ln ON rr.line_id = ln.line_id
, orange_line_2018_avg ol_avg
WHERE 
  rr.season = 'Fall 2018' AND
  rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01' AND
  rr.direction = 0 AND
  ln.line_id = 'orange' AND
  ln.line_name = 'Orange Line' AND
  rr.total_ons > ol_avg.avg_total_ons
ORDER BY 
  rr.total_ons DESC, 
  st.station_name ASC;
```

This query constructs a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `orange_line_2018_avg` to compute the average `total_ons` for Orange Line stations during the specified season, time period, and direction. Then, in the main query, it uses that average value to filter out the stations whose `total_ons` exceeds the average, joining with the `stations` and `lines` tables to provide the requested station names along with their respective `total_ons` values. It sorts the results by `total_ons` in descending order and then by `station_name` in ascending order.

PASSING USER PROMPT:Find the station with most number of routes passing through it. (E.g. North Station has six routes passing through it: orange line in both directions and two green lines in both directions) Report station_name, route_id, line_id, and total number of routes passing through the station. Sort the results by line_id in ascending order and then route_id in ascending order.

Your SQL query should use columns station_id, route_cnt, route_id, station_name, and line_id, along with the MAX and COUNT aggregation function.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1337
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the station with the most number of routes passing through it, we need to count the distinct number of routes per station and then find the station with the maximum count. Here's how you can accomplish this with an SQL query:

```sql
WITH StationRouteCounts AS (
    SELECT
        s.station_id,
        s.station_name,
        so.route_id,
        r.line_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) OVER (PARTITION BY s.station_id) as route_cnt
    FROM
        station_orders so
    JOIN stations s ON
        so.station_id = s.station_id
    JOIN routes r ON
        so.route_id = r.route_id
),
MaxRoutes AS (
    SELECT
        station_id,
        station_name,
        route_id,
        line_id,
        route_cnt,
        MAX(route_cnt) OVER () as max_route_count
    FROM
        StationRouteCounts
)
SELECT
    station_name,
    route_id,
    line_id,
    route_cnt
FROM
    MaxRoutes
WHERE
    route_cnt = max_route_count
ORDER BY
    line_id ASC,
    route_id ASC;
```

This query works in the following way:
1. In the CTE `StationRouteCounts`, we calculate the number of distinct routes passing through each station for each route. We use a window function `COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) OVER (PARTITION BY s.station_id)` to count the routes and partition by station so each station will have a count of unique routes.

2. In the CTE `MaxRoutes`, we use a window function `MAX(route_cnt) OVER ()` to calculate the maximum route count for all stations.

3. Finally, we select the `station_name`, `route_id`, `line_id`, and calculated `route_cnt` from the `MaxRoutes` CTE where the `route_cnt` is equal to `max_route_count`, indicating that these are the records with the most routes.

4. The results are ordered by `line_id` in ascending order, and then `route_id` in ascending order. 

The query will return the station with the most routes, along with the details of the route and line. If there are multiple stations with the same maximum number of routes, it will return all of them.

That is, the station "s” that has the largest ratio "(a - b)/a”, where "a” is the the sum of average_flow values for all time periods and all directions of "s” and "b” is the total sum of: the sum of its average_ons and sum of its average_offs values. Therefore, the ratio "(a - b)/a” represents the proportion of people who bypassed one station. Report the station name, its line name, and its bypassed ratio. Sort the results by line name in ascending order. HINT: You may need to use function C AST(total_flow AS REAL) to cast the summation of flows (i.e. "a” above) to real number.

Your SQL query should use columns station_id, line_id, average_flow, average_ons, average_offs, season, station_name, and line_name, along with the MAX, CAST, and SUM functions.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1450
MODEL'S ANSWER: This query involves several steps: calculating the sum of average_flow, average_ons, and average_offs per station for each line, then computing the ratio "(a - b)/a" for each of these stations, and finally finding the station with the maximum ratio per line. The following query will accomplish this:

```sql
WITH BypassedRatios AS (
    SELECT
        rr.station_id,
        rr.line_id,
        SUM(rr.average_flow) AS total_flow,
        SUM(rr.average_ons + rr.average_offs) AS total_ons_offs
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    WHERE
        rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY
        rr.station_id,
        rr.line_id
),
BypassedRatiosWithStationNames AS (
    SELECT
        br.station_id,
        st.station_name,
        br.line_id,
        CAST(br.total_flow AS REAL) AS total_flow,
        br.total_ons_offs,
        (CAST(br.total_flow AS REAL) - br.total_ons_offs) / CAST(br.total_flow AS REAL) AS bypassed_ratio
    FROM
        BypassedRatios br
    JOIN
        stations st ON br.station_id = st.station_id
),
MaxBypassedRatios AS (
    SELECT
        brws.line_id,
        MAX(brws.bypassed_ratio) AS max_bypassed_ratio
    FROM
        BypassedRatiosWithStationNames brws
    GROUP BY
        brws.line_id
)
SELECT
    mb.line_id,
    l.line_name,
    br.station_name,
    br.bypassed_ratio
FROM
    MaxBypassedRatios mb
JOIN
    BypassedRatiosWithStationNames br ON mb.line_id = br.line_id AND mb.max_bypassed_ratio = br.bypassed_ratio
JOIN
    lines l ON mb.line_id = l.line_id
ORDER BY
    l.line_name;
```

Here is a breakdown of what the query is doing:

1. In the CTE `BypassedRatios`, we compute the total average_flow and the sum of average_ons and average_offs for each station within the same line for the Fall 2019 season.

2. In the next CTE `BypassedRatiosWithStationNames`, we join the previously computed ratios with the station names. We also calculate the bypassed ratio "(a - b)/a" for each station and cast the total_flow to REAL to ensure proper division.

3. `MaxBypassedRatios` CTE is used to find the maximum bypassed ratio for each line.

4. Finally, we join the `MaxBypassedRatios` with the `BypassedRatiosWithStationNames` CTE and the lines table to select and return the station name, its line name, and the bypassed ratio. We then sort the results by line name in ascending order.

Please note that since the `MAX` function is used, there could potentially be ties for the max bypassed ratio for a given line. In such cases, this query will return all stations having the maximum ratio since there are no tie-breaking rules specified. If you wanted to limit the results to only one station per line you would need to introduce additional tie-breaking logic.
