PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we need to calculate the average age of all singers first, and then select the song names of singers whose age is above that average. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query includes a subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` that calculates the average age of all singers. The main query then compares each singer's age in the `singer` table with this average and selects the `Song_Name` where the condition is met (singer's age is greater than the average age).

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 662
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we will need to first count the number of concerts held at each stadium since 2014 and then find the stadium with the maximum number of concerts.

Here is how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM (
    SELECT c.Stadium_ID, COUNT(c.concert_ID) as NumberOfConcerts
    FROM concert c
    WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
    GROUP BY c.Stadium_ID
    ORDER BY NumberOfConcerts DESC
    LIMIT 1
) AS MostConcertsStadium
JOIN stadium s ON s.Stadium_ID = MostConcertsStadium.Stadium_ID;
```

This query performs the following:

1. Subquery (aliased as MostConcertsStadium):
    - Selects the `Stadium_ID` from the `concert` table where the `Year` is 2014 or later.
    - Groups the results by `Stadium_ID`.
    - Counts the number of concerts for each stadium (`COUNT(c.concert_ID)`).
    - Orders the results by the number of concerts in descending order.
    - Limits the results to only the top stadium (with the most concerts), using `LIMIT 1`.

2. Main query:
    - Joins the `stadium` table with the subquery on the `Stadium_ID` to get the name and capacity of the stadium with the most number of concerts.

This will give you the stadium name and capacity that has hosted the most number of concerts since the year 2014.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums that haven't hosted any concerts, you can perform a LEFT JOIN operation between the stadium table and the concert table, and then look for NULL values in the joined concert table's fields. The query looks like this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Stadium_ID IS NULL;
```

This SQL query joins the `stadium` table (`s`) and the `concert` table (`c`) on the `Stadium_ID` field. It filters results to include only those stadiums that do not have a corresponding `Stadium_ID` in the `concert` table, which indicates that no concerts were held in those stadiums. The query then returns the names of those stadiums.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 660
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, we need to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to get the number of singers for each concert. We can do this by using the `GROUP BY` clause to group the concerts together and count the number of singers for each group. Here is the SQL query that will achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name, 
    c.Theme, 
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) as NumberOfSingers
FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID, c.concert_Name, c.Theme;
```

This query will give you a list of all concerts with their names, themes, and the corresponding number of singers who performed in each concert. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a concert had no singers (which theoretically shouldn't happen but could be possible based on data), it will still be displayed in the result with a count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts for each singer, we need to join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and then perform a `GROUP BY` operation to count the number of concerts for each singer. The following SQL query should provide the desired result:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Concert_Count
FROM singer s
JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY s.Name;
```

This query works by:
1. Joining the `singer` table (aliased as 's') with the `singer_in_concert` table (aliased as 'sic') on their `Singer_ID` fields.
2. Using `GROUP BY s.Name` to aggregate results by each unique singer name.
3. Using `COUNT(sic.concert_ID)` as an aggregate function to count the number of concerts for each singer (since each row in the `singer_in_concert` table represents a performance of a singer in a concert).
4. Selecting the `s.Name` as singer name and the count as `Concert_Count`.

The result will be a list showing each singer's name and the number of concerts in which they have performed.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 668
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we can perform a simple SELECT query from the singer table with a WHERE clause that filters song names containing the word 'Hey'. Here's the SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query uses the LIKE operator with the pattern `%Hey%`, which will match any song name that includes 'Hey' anywhere in the title. Keep in mind that the pattern matching is case-insensitive in many SQL databases, but if you are using a case-sensitive database, you may need to adjust the pattern or use a function to lower the case of the song names before comparing.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 454
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students who are over 20 years old, we need to perform a join between the `Student` table and the `Has_Pet` table based on their `StuID` columns, filtering out the students that are 20 years old or younger, and then count the distinct number of pets associated with the remaining students.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT h.PetID) as NumberOfPets
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet h ON s.StuID = h.StuID
WHERE s.Age > 20;
```

This query selects the student records from the `Student` table where the `Age` column value is greater than 20, then it joins those records with the `Has_Pet` table based on the `StuID` column. The `COUNT(DISTINCT h.PetID)` function is used to ensure we're only counting each pet once in case there are multiple references to the same pet (although in a well-structured database a pet should not be owned by more than one student, but we use DISTINCT as a safeguard). The `as NumberOfPets` is an alias to give the count a meaningful name in the result.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 456
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students, we need to perform an INNER JOIN between the "Student" table and the "Has_Pet" table to correlate the student information with the pet ownership. Then, we have to join that result set with the "Pets" table to get the pets' information. We'll count the number of entries where the pet type is 'dog' and the student sex is 'F'.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPetsOwnedByFemaleStudents
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the "Student" table with the "Has_Pet" table where their "StuID" columns match.
- Joins the resulting table from the above join with the "Pets" table where the "Has_Pet" table's "PetID" column matches the "Pets" table's "PetID" column.
- Filters the result to only include rows where the sex of the student is female (indicated by 'F') and the pet type is 'dog'.
- Counts the rows that match these criteria returning the total number of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this, we will need to use the "continents" and "countries" tables. We will execute an SQL query using the JOIN operation to combine the records from these two tables based on the continent ID, and then perform a COUNT aggregation to get the number of countries per continent.

Here's the SQL query that will provide the requested information:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId, 
    c.Continent, 
    COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM 
    continents c
LEFT JOIN 
    countries co
ON 
    c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY 
    c.ContId, 
    c.Continent;
```

This query selects the continent ID and continent name from the "continents" table and counts the number of country IDs from the "countries" table after joining them on the condition that the continent ID matches. It groups the results based on the continent ID and name to ensure that we get the count for each continent. The LEFT JOIN is used to ensure that even if a continent does not have any countries, it will still be included in the result with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 870
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this question, you can use a SQL `JOIN` to combine the relevant tables and an aggregate function `COUNT` to count the number of models for each car maker. Here's the SQL query that produces the required information:

```sql
SELECT
    cm.FullName,
    cm.Id,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM
    car_makers cm
JOIN
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY
    cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query selects the full name and ID of each car maker from the `car_makers` table and joins it with the `model_list` table on the makers' IDs. It then counts the number of models associated with each car maker by using the `COUNT` aggregate function on `ml.ModelId`, grouping the results by the car maker's ID (`cm.Id`) and full name (`cm.FullName`). 

The resulting output will contain three columns: `FullName`, `Id`, and `NumberOfModels`. Each row represents a car maker with the corresponding number of models they produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker, along with its ID and the number of models it produces, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName;
```

This query performs the following actions:

1. It selects the `Id` and `FullName` columns from the `car_makers` table (aliased as `cm`).
2. It joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table using the `Id` column in `car_makers` and the `Maker` column in `model_list` (aliased as `ml`).
3. It groups the results by the car maker's `Id` and `FullName` since we want a count of models for each car maker.
4. It counts the number of models associated with each car maker by counting `ModelId` in the `model_list` table.

The result will list each car maker's full name, id, and the total number of models produced by them.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 861
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we first need to identify the minimum horsepower value from the `cars_data` table and then find the corresponding model from the `car_names` table. Because the `Horsepower` column is of type `TEXT`, we need to convert it to a numeric type to find the minimum correctly. Assuming that there are no non-numeric values in the `Horsepower` column, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) = (
    SELECT MIN(CAST(Horsepower AS INTEGER))
    FROM cars_data
    WHERE Horsepower NOT LIKE 'null' -- Exclude rows where Horsepower is 'null' or cannot be converted to INTEGER
);
```

In the subquery, we are finding the minimum horsepower value after casting the column to INTEGER, while excluding any horsepower values that cannot be converted (like 'null').

In the outer query, we are joining the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table by the make ID and then matching the rows with this minimum horsepower value to get the associated car model(s). Note that there may be more than one model with the same minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 863
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the distinct car models produced after 1980, first, we need to join the tables `car_names` and `cars_data` based on `MakeId` and `Id` respectively. We only want models produced after the year 1980, so we will also apply a `WHERE` condition to filter the results. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return a list of unique car models that were created after the year 1980.
