PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 805
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `concert` and `stadium` tables, filter the results by the `Year`, group by the `Stadium_ID`, and then count the concerts for each stadium. Afterwards, we need to order the results by the count in descending order and limit it to the top result. Here’s how you do it:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This SQL query does the following:
- Joins the `stadium` and `concert` tables on their `Stadium_ID` columns.
- Filters the joined table to only include concerts from the year 2014 or later.
- Groups the results by `Stadium_ID`.
- Counts the number of concerts for each stadium.
- Orders the groups by the count in descending order.
- Limits the result to the stadium with the highest count.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?

Your SQL query should use columns name and stadium_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 792
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of the stadiums without any concerts, we can perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `stadium` and `concert` tables and look for those entries where there is no matching `concert_ID` in the `concert` table. Here is the query to do that:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query selects the `Name` from the `stadium` table (aliased as `s`) and left joins it with the `concert` table (aliased as `c`) using the `Stadium_ID` columns from both tables. The `WHERE` clause filters out the rows where `concert_ID` is not null, which means we only get the stadiums that have no associated concerts.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .

Your SQL query should use columns name and singer_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 792
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill the request, we need to join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table to count the number of concerts each singer has performed in. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name, 
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS NumberOfConcerts
FROM 
    singer s
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY 
    s.Singer_ID;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `singer` table (aliased as `s`) with the `singer_in_concert` table (aliased as `sic`) on their common `Singer_ID` column.
- Counts the number of concert IDs (`COUNT(sic.concert_ID)`) associated with each singer.
- Groups the result by the `Singer_ID` so that the count is calculated per singer.
- Selects the `Name` from the `singer` table, and the count of concerts is aliased as `NumberOfConcerts`.

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that we include singers who might not have participated in any concerts, giving them a concert count of 0. If you only want to count singers who have participated in at least one concert, you can use an `INNER JOIN` instead.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?

Your SQL query should use columns name, country, and song_name.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 809
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, you would use the `singer` table and specifically look in the `Song_Name` column for the pattern 'Hey'. You can use the `LIKE` operator with the wildcard `%` to search for this pattern within the song titles.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    Name,
    Country,
    Song_Name
FROM
    singer
WHERE
    Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query will return a list of singers with their names, countries, and song titles that contain the word 'Hey' anywhere in the title.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: Sure, to retrieve the number of countries per continent along with the continent ID and name, you can use a JOIN between the continents and countries tables and then aggregate the data using a GROUP BY statement. A COUNT function will be used to get the number of countries.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent,
    COUNT(ct.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM
    continents c
LEFT JOIN
    countries ct ON c.ContId = ct.Continent
GROUP BY
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent;
```

This query joins the continents and countries tables on their ContId and Continent columns, respectively, and then groups the results by ContId (continent ID) and Continent (continent name). The COUNT function is applied to the CountryId from the countries table, giving the total number of countries within each continent. The LEFT JOIN ensures that even if a continent doesn't have any associated countries, it will still appear in the results with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this question, we need to count the number of models each car maker produces. We will join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and group the results by the car maker's `Id` and `FullName`. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query will list the full name and ID of the car maker along with the count of different models that each produces.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1033
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill the given request, we must write a SQL query that joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table, grouping by the car maker's `Id` and counting the number of models each car maker produces. We will then select columns `FullName`, `Id`, and a count of models. Here's how the query should look:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.FullName,
    cm.Id,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml
ON 
    cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName;
```

This query joins the `car_makers` table (aliased as `cm`) with the `model_list` table (aliased as `ml`) based on the `cm.Id` being equal to `ml.Maker`. We're using a LEFT JOIN so we include car makers even if they have no models listed. It then groups the results by `cm.Id` and `cm.FullName` and counts the number of models using `COUNT(ml.ModelId)`. The `NumberOfModels` alias represents the count of models produced by each car maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1025
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we need to join the `cars_data` table with the `car_names` table and order the result by the `Horsepower` column to identify the minimum value.

Since the `Horsepower` column is stored as TEXT, to accurately sort by the actual numeric value, we need to convert it to an integer or real. We also need to handle potentially missing or non-numeric data that could interfere with the conversion. We'll use the `CAST` function to convert `Horsepower` from TEXT to INTEGER and then order the results.

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cd.Horsepower
FROM cars_data AS cd
JOIN car_names AS cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower NOT LIKE 'not available' -- Exclude records where horsepower is not available
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query retrieves the model and horsepower of the car with the lowest horsepower, excluding any records where the horsepower is 'not available'. The ordering is done in ascending order, with a limit of 1 to retrieve only the model with the minimum horsepower value.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1028
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table, as the year information is stored in `cars_data` and the model information is stored in `car_names`. Since we're focusing only on distinct models, we will be using the DISTINCT clause.

Here's the SQL query for the task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names AS cn
JOIN cars_data AS cd
ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query selects the distinct `Model` values from the `car_names` table, aliasing it as `cn`, and joins it with the `cars_data` table, aliasing it as `cd`, on the `MakeId` and `Id` columns. It then filters out the records where the `Year` in the `cars_data` table is greater than 1980.
