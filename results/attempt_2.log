PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the different countries with singers above age 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 782
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the different countries with singers above age 20, we need to use the `singer` table. We'll use a `SELECT DISTINCT` to get unique country names where the age of the singer is greater than 20. Here's the SQL query that will achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country
FROM singer
WHERE Age > 20;
```

When you run this query on your database, it will return a list of unique countries that have singers above the age of 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 781
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we first need to determine the average age of the singers. Then, we can find all singers whose age is above this average and list their songs. Here is the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query works in the following way:

1. `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` calculates the average age of all singers.
2. The main `SELECT` statement retrieves the `Song_Name` from the `singer` table where the `Age` of the singer is greater than the average age as computed in the first step.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 789
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `stadium` and `concert` tables, filter the concerts by the year, group by the stadium to count the number of concerts, and order the results to find the stadium with the most concerts. We can achieve this with the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query performs the following actions:
- Joins the `stadium` table with the `concert` table on the matching `Stadium_ID`.
- Filters the concerts to include only those in the year 2014 or later using a `WHERE` clause.
- Groups the results by `Stadium_ID` from the `stadium` table.
- Orders the groups by the count of `concert_ID` in the `concert` table in descending order to get the stadium with the most concerts first.
- Limits the results to only one row to get the stadium with the most number of concerts.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To achieve this, we need to count the number of singers for each concert, which will involve joining the `concert` and `singer_in_concert` tables, and then grouping the results by concert to count the singers. Here is the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name,

FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY

```

This query will return the name and theme of each concert from the `concert` table (c) alongside the count of related entries from the `singer_in_concert` table (sic), therefore giving us the number of singers for each concert. 

Note that we use a `LEFT JOIN` to include all concerts, even those without any singers, to ensure that concerts with zero singers are also shown. If there were any concerts without any singer, the count would show as 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 795
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, I will write a SQL query to select the relevant information from the "singer" table where the "Song_Name" contains the word 'Hey'. The SQL query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query uses the LIKE operator with a pattern that includes '%Hey%'. The '%' wildcard matches any sequence of characters, which means it will match song titles that contain the word 'Hey' anywhere in the title.

Please note that the case sensitivity of the LIKE operator can depend on the database system's settings. If you need to ensure the search is case-insensitive (for databases where LIKE is case-sensitive by default), you may need to use a lower or upper function on both sides of the comparison or use ILIKE if your database supports it.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 535
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this question, we need to count the number of pets owned by students over the age of 20. We need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on the `StuID` column and then filter the result for students whose age is greater than 20. Here is the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `Student` table and the `Has_Pet` table on the `StuID` column so we can get the relation between students and their pets.
- The `WHERE` clause filters out students who are 20 years old or younger.
- Then it counts the unique `PetID`s from the `Has_Pet` table to get the total number of pets owned by these students.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each pet is only counted once, even if, for some reason, there were duplicate records of the same pet ownership.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 537
MODEL'S ANSWER: To solve this, we need to join the `Student`, `Has_Pet`, and `Pets` tables and count where the conditions match i.e. `PetType` is 'dog' and `Student.Sex` is 'F'.

Here's the SQL query to find the number of dog pets raised by female students:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Pets.PetID) AS NumberOfFemaleStudentsWithDogs
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID
WHERE Pets.PetType = 'dog' AND Student.Sex = 'F';
```

This query counts the distinct `PetID`s with the specified conditions to ensure each dog is only counted once, even if it somehow appears multiple times in the `Has_Pet` table.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1020
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many countries each continent has, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the "countries" table with the "continents" table on the "Continent" and "ContId" fields, groups the results by the continent, and counts the number of countries per continent.

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents c
LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY NumberOfCountries DESC;
```

In this query, I'm using a LEFT JOIN to include continents even if they have no countries associated with them (although logically, a continent should have at least one country). The results are grouped by the continent's ID and name, with the count of countries for each group. The results are ordered by the count in descending order to show the continents with the most countries first.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, you need to join the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables, and then perform a count of the `Model` for each `car_makers.Id`. You can use a GROUP BY clause to get the count of models per maker. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id, cm.FullName, COUNT(ml.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName
ORDER BY NumberOfModels DESC;
```

This query will give you a list of all car makers with their full names, id, and the number of models they produce, sorted from the one with the most models to the least.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1020
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this request, we will perform the following SQL query:

1. Join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on the `Id` column from `car_makers` and the `Maker` column from `model_list`.
2. Count the number of models for each car maker using the `COUNT` aggregate function.
3. Group the results by the car maker's id and full name to ensure we are counting the number of models per maker.

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id, 
    cm.FullName, 
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels 
FROM 
    car_makers cm
JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker 
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, 
    cm.FullName;
```

This query will return a list of all car makers, their ids, full names, and the count of models they each produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1009
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we need to join the `cars_data` table with the `car_names` table to get the model's name alongside the horsepower, and then we can order the result by the horsepower to find the model with the minimum horsepower.

Here is the query to find the model with the minimum horsepower:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) as MinHorsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower NOT LIKE 'NULL' AND TRIM(cd.Horsepower) <> '' -- excludes rows with non-numeric Horsepower data
GROUP BY cn.Model
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query joins the `cars_data` table (`cd`) with the `car_names` table (`cn`) using the `Id` from `cars_data` and `MakeId` from `car_names`. It then filters out any rows where `Horsepower` is not a numeric value (since 'Horsepower' column is TEXT, it might contain 'NULL' as text or empty strings which need to be handled). The `MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER))` function is used to convert the `Horsepower` values to integers so they can be compared numerically, and it finds the minimum value amongst them. The result is ordered in ascending order and limited to the first row which contains the model with the minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1011
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to join the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables since the relevant information is split across these two tables. The `car_names` table contains information about the car model and make, while the `cars_data` table contains the year in which the car make was created. 

To get the distinct car models produced after 1980, we perform the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names AS cn
JOIN cars_data AS cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query joins the `car_names` as `cn` and `cars_data` as `cd` tables on their `MakeId` and `Id` fields respectively and filters the results where the `Year` column value is greater than 1980. Then it selects distinct `Model` values from the `car_names` table based on this condition.
