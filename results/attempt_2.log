PASSING USER PROMPT: What are all distinct countries where singers above age 20 are from ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 657
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find all distinct countries where singers above the age of 20 are from, we need to query the `singer` table. We will use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that each country is only listed once, and we will add a condition to select only those singers who are older than 20. Here's the SQL query for this request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Age" > 20;
``` 

This query selects unique ("DISTINCT") country names from the `singer` table where the `Age` of the singer is greater than 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find all the song names by singers above the average age, we first need to determine what the average age is across all singers. Once we know the average age, we can select song names from those singers who are above this average age. Here's the SQL query that does this:

```sql
WITH AverageAge AS (
    SELECT AVG(Age) AS AvgAge FROM singer
)
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s, AverageAge a
WHERE s.Age > a.AvgAge;
```

This query first calculates the average age of all singers using a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `AverageAge`. Then, it uses a `JOIN` to filter out the singers who are above the average age and selects their song names.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 662
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we would have to join the `stadium` and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID`, then filter the concerts by the year, group by the `Stadium_ID` to count the concerts for each stadium, and finally, order them to find the stadium with the most concerts.

Here is how you can write the SQL query for this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name AS StadiumName, 
    s.Capacity, 
    COUNT(c.Stadium_ID) as NumberOfConcerts
FROM 
    stadium s
JOIN 
    concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE 
    c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY 
    s.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY 
    NumberOfConcerts DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This will return the stadium name and its capacity that had the most concerts from 2014 onwards. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top stadium (one with the most concerts) is returned.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To determine the names of the stadiums without any concerts, we have to identify those stadiums that do not have a corresponding entry in the "concert" table. We can do this by performing a LEFT JOIN between the "stadium" and "concert" tables and then filtering the results to show only those entries that have a NULL value for the "concert_ID". Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query selects the name of the stadium (`s.Name`) from the "stadium" table (aliased as 's') and performs a LEFT JOIN with the "concert" table (aliased as 'c') based on the matching "Stadium_ID". The `WHERE` clause filters for those results where there is no matching "concert_ID" (i.e., `c.concert_ID IS NULL`), which indicates that no concerts have been recorded for that stadium.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 660
MODEL'S ANSWER: To show the name and theme for all concerts along with the number of singers in each concert, we can use SQL `JOIN` statement to join the `concert` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and then use the `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of singers per concert. Here is the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.concert_Name,
    c.Theme,
    COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) AS NumberOfSingers
FROM 
    concert c
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY 
    c.concert_ID, 
    c.concert_Name, 
    c.Theme;
```

This query works as follows:

1. It selects the `concert_Name` and `Theme` from the `concert` table aliased as `c`.
2. It does a `LEFT JOIN` with the `singer_in_concert` table aliased as `sic` on their common `concert_ID` columns.
3. It uses `COUNT()` to count the number of `Singer_ID` from `singer_in_concert`, giving us the number of singers in each concert.
4. The result is grouped by the `concert_ID`, `concert_Name`, and `Theme` to ensure each concert is listed individually along with the number of singers who performed in it.

Note that we use `LEFT JOIN` because we want to include all concerts, even those that might not have any singer associated with them. In that case, they would still appear in the output with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts each has performed in, we need to join the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables, and then use the `COUNT` function to count the number of concerts per singer. After that, we can group the results by the singer's ID and name.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name AS Singer_Name, 
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Number_of_Concerts
FROM 
    singer s
JOIN 
    singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY 
    s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query does the following:
1. Selects the `Name` column from the `singer` table and aliases it as `Singer_Name`.
2. Counts the number of `concert_ID` from the `singer_in_concert` table for each singer and aliases this count as `Number_of_Concerts`.
3. Joins the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table on their `Singer_ID` columns.
4. Groups the results by the `Singer_ID` and `Name` columns from the `singer` table so that we get the number of concerts for each singer.
5. Returns the singer's name and the count of their concerts.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 668
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we need to examine the `singer` table and filter the records where the column `Song_Name` contains the word 'Hey'. Assuming the word 'Hey' should be case-insensitive and that we're looking for exact matches (the word 'Hey' should stand by itself, not as a part of another word), you can perform a case-insensitive search using the `ILIKE` operator for PostgreSQL or `LIKE` with appropriate pattern matching for other SQL dialects.

Here's how you could write the SQL query:

For PostgreSQL (using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive search):
```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE "Song_Name" ILIKE '%Hey%';
```

For other SQL databases (using `LIKE` with pattern matching):
```sql
SELECT "Name", "Country"
FROM "singer"
WHERE LOWER("Song_Name") LIKE '%hey%';
```

This query looks through the `singer` table and returns the `Name` and `Country` columns for rows where `Song_Name` includes the word 'Hey'. Using `LOWER()` function ensures the search is case-insensitive in databases that don't have ILIKE. The percent signs (`%`) are wildcards that match any sequence of characters before and after 'hey', meaning 'Hey' can appear anywhere in the song's title.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 454
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students who are older than 20, we need to perform a count operation on the `Pets` table while joining it with the `Has_Pet` and `Student` tables. Specifically, we need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on the `StuID` column to get the pet ownership information, and then apply a filter to include only those students who have an age greater than 20.

The SQL query to find this information would be:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) AS NumberOfPetsOwnedByStudentsOver20
FROM Has_Pet hp
JOIN Student s ON hp.StuID = s.StuID
WHERE s.Age > 20;
```

This query first joins the `Has_Pet` table with the `Student` table on the `StuID` field. Then, it filters the result to only include rows where the age of the student is greater than 20. This result set would contain the pet ownership details for students older than 20. The `COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID)` function then counts the distinct number of pet IDs from this result set, which gives us the total number of unique pets owned by these students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 456
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students, we need to join the `Student`, `Has_Pet`, and `Pets` tables. We should filter the `Student` table for female students using the `Sex` column and then join with the `Has_Pet` table to determine which pets are owned by these students. Afterwards, we join the `Pets` table to filter for pets of the type 'dog'. Finally, we can count the number of dogs.

Here's the SQL query that would do this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfFemaleOwnedDogs
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query counts the number of rows where the `Sex` column is 'F' for female students and the `PetType` is 'dog', which represents the number of dogs raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many countries each continent has, you'll need to join the `continents` table with the `countries` table and then perform a `COUNT` aggregation on the `CountryId`. Here's the SQL query that will perform this task:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId, c.Continent, COUNT(co.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents c
LEFT JOIN countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY c.ContId;
```

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even continents without any countries will still be listed, with `0` as the count. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by continent, and the `COUNT` function is used to determine the number of countries per continent. We're also ordering by `ContId` to have a consistent output.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the required information, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table to count how many models each car maker produces. We must perform a group by operation on the `car_makers.Id` and use a count on the model_list to get the number of models for each maker.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id
```

This query starts by selecting the `Id` and `FullName` from the `car_makers` table (aliased as `cm`), and counts the total number of models (`ModelId`) from the `model_list` table (aliased as `ml`) for each car maker. It uses a LEFT JOIN to include car makers even if they have no models associated with them (in which case, the count would be zero). It groups the result by `car_makers.Id` to ensure that we get a count of models for each individual car maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 861
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we first need to figure out the minimum horsepower value from the `cars_data` table. Next, we match that to the model found in the `car_names` table. However, the `Horsepower` column is defined as `TEXT`, so we need to convert it to a numerical value before we can find the minimum. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to find this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) AS MinHorsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA'     -- Exclude records where Horsepower is not available
GROUP BY cn.Model                -- Group by Model to be able to select it
ORDER BY MinHorsepower           -- Order by the minimum horsepower found 
LIMIT 1;                         -- Get only the top record, which is the minimum
```

This query is structured to handle cases where the 'Horsepower' might have a non-numeric value such as 'NA'. This is common in datasets where some information might be missing. By excluding these records, the query ensures only valid horsepower figures are considered. Then we group by the model and order by the minimum horsepower, but only select the top result since we are looking for the single model with the minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 863
MODEL'S ANSWER: To determine the distinct car models produced after 1980, we would need to join the `cars_data` table and the `car_names` table, and then filter by the `Year` column. Here is the appropriate SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query selects distinct `Model` names from the `car_names` table (aliased as `cn`) by joining it with the `cars_data` table (aliased as `cd`) on their respective `MakeId` and `Id` columns. It then filters for those car models where the `Year` of production is greater than 1980 in the `cars_data` table.
