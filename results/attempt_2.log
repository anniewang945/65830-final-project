PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. concert.stadium_id
2. concert.year
3. stadium.stadium_id
4. stadium.name
5. stadium.capacity

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 848
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to count the number of concerts by stadium and filter for the ones in the specified years. It will also involve using a subquery or a common table expression to determine which stadium has the most concerts and then ordering and limiting the results. Here's the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    st.Name, 
    st.Capacity
FROM 
    stadium st
INNER JOIN 
    (SELECT 
        c.Stadium_ID, 
        COUNT(*) AS num_concerts
     FROM 
        concert c
     WHERE 
        c.Year >= '2014'
     GROUP BY 
        c.Stadium_ID) AS concert_counts
ON 
    st.Stadium_ID = concert_counts.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY 
    concert_counts.num_concerts DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query does the following:
1. Filters out concerts from the `concert` table that occurred in 2014 or after.
2. Groups the concerts by `Stadium_ID` and counts them.
3. Joins this result with the `stadium` table based on `Stadium_ID`.
4. Orders the resulting joined records by the number of concerts in descending order.
5. Limits the result to the top record to get the stadium with the highest number of concerts.

2. concert.concert_name
3. concert.theme
4. concert.concert_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 846
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill the request, we need to join the `concert` table with `singer_in_concert` and group the data by concert, to count the number of singers in each concert. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    concert.concert_Name,
    concert.Theme,
    COUNT(singer_in_concert.Singer_ID) as Number_of_Singers
FROM 
    concert 
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert 
ON 
    concert.concert_ID = singer_in_concert.concert_ID 
GROUP BY 
    concert.concert_ID;
```

This query will show the name and theme of all concerts along with the total number of singers who performed in each concert. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even concerts without any performers will be included in the results, with a singer count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. singer.name
2. singer.singer_id
3. singer_in_concert.singer_id

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 833
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts each singer has performed in, we need to join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and count the number of concerts. Here is the SQL query that will achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
  singer.Name,
  COUNT(singer_in_concert.concert_ID) AS NumberOfConcerts
FROM
  singer
LEFT JOIN singer_in_concert ON singer.Singer_ID = singer_in_concert.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
  singer.Singer_ID;
```

This query performs a LEFT JOIN between the `singer` table and the `singer_in_concert` table on the `Singer_ID` field, which ensures that all singers are listed, even if they haven't participated in any concerts. It then groups the results by `singer.Singer_ID` and counts the number of concert IDs associated with each singer to calculate the number of concerts they have performed in. The result will show each singer's name along with the corresponding number of concerts.

1. student.stuid
2. student.age
3. has_pet.stuid

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 583
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20, we can perform the following steps:
1. Select the students whose age is greater than 20.
2. Use a JOIN operation to link those students to the Has_Pet table to find their pets.
3. Count the number of pets associated with these students.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) as NumberOfPets
FROM Student 
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query counts the unique pet IDs that belong to students older than 20. We use `DISTINCT` to ensure that we count each pet only once, even if for some reason the data contains duplicates.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. continents.contid
2. continents.continent
3. countries.continent
SQL:  select t1.contid ,  t1.continent ,  count(*) from continents as t1 
join countries as t2 on t1.contid  =  t2.continent group by t1.contid;
Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1127
MODEL'S ANSWER: To achieve this, you will need to use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by continent and count the number of countries for each continent. Also, you will have to use the `JOIN` clause to join the continents and countries tables based on their relationship. Here is the SQL query to list the continent id, continent name, and the number of countries for each continent:

```sql
SELECT c.ContId AS ContId, 
       c.Continent AS Continent, 
       COUNT(country.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents AS c
LEFT JOIN countries AS country ON c.ContId = country.Continent
GROUP BY c.ContId, c.Continent
ORDER BY NumberOfCountries DESC;
```

The `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that even continents with no countries are included in the result with a count of zero. We are also ordering the results by the `NumberOfCountries` in descending order to list the continents with the most countries first.

The alias `c` refers to the `continents` table, and `country` refers to the `countries` table in the join operation. Each group in the result corresponds to a different continent, and the count of countries in each continent is calculated using `COUNT(country.CountryId)`. We include `ContId` and `Continent` in the `GROUP BY` to group the results appropriately.

The columns `Contid` and `Continent` from the `continents` table are included in the `SELECT` statement as requested.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1070
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, we need to count the number of entries in the `model_list` table that correspond to each maker in the `car_makers` table. We can do this using a `JOIN` along with a `GROUP BY` clause. Here's the SQL query to perform this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    car_makers.FullName,
    car_makers.Id,
    COUNT(model_list.Maker) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers
JOIN model_list
    ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
    car_makers.Id,
    car_makers.FullName;
```

This query will give us the full name and ID of each car maker along with the number of models they produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the full name of each car maker along with its ID and the number of models it produces, we can use a `JOIN` between the tables `car_makers` and `model_list`, and then perform a `COUNT` on the number of models grouped by car maker. Here's the SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
  car_makers.Id,
  car_makers.FullName,
  COUNT(model_list.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
  car_makers
LEFT JOIN 
  model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
  car_makers.Id,
  car_makers.FullName;
```

This SQL query joins the `car_makers` table and the `model_list` table on the `Id` of car makers and the `Maker` column of the model list. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a car maker doesn't have any models, it will still appear in the result with a count of zero. The `COUNT` function counts the number of models associated with each car maker. Then we use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by the `car_makers.Id` and `car_makers.FullName` to ensure that counts are accurate for each car maker. The number of models each car maker produces is returned in the alias `NumberOfModels`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_names.model
2. car_names.makeid
3. cars_data.id
4. cars_data.horsepower

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1066
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car that has the minimum horsepower, you would need to join the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables based on their respective `MakeId` and `Id` columns, and then order the results by `Horsepower` to get the one with the lowest horsepower value. However, since the `Horsepower` column is recorded as TEXT, you must cast it to a numeric value for proper comparison.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'NA' -- Exclude rows with 'NA' which may not be convertible to numeric values
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)
LIMIT 1;
```

Please note, this query assumes that the `Horsepower` column may contain 'NA' values that cannot be converted to numbers. If this is not the case or if 'NA' values have a different representation in your dataset, this WHERE clause should be modified accordingly.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to join the `model_list` table with the `car_names` table and the `cars_data` table. We will then filter the results for cars with the `Year` greater than 1980, and select the distinct `Model` values from the `model_list` table.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ml.Model
FROM model_list ml
JOIN car_names cn ON ml.ModelId = cn.MakeId
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will list distinct names of the car models that were produced after the year 1980.
