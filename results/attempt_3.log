PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .

Your SQL query should use columns name, capacity, stadium_id, and year.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 805
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `stadium`, and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID` field, filter the results to include only concerts from 2014 or later, group by `Stadium_ID` and count the number of concerts at each stadium, and then select the stadium with the maximum count along with the required fields. Here's how you can do it with an SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name, 
    s.Capacity
FROM 
    stadium s
JOIN 
    concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE 
    c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY 
    s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the stadium name (s.Name) and capacity (s.Capacity) from the `stadium` table aliased as `s`, joins with the `concert` table aliased as `c` on the common `Stadium_ID` field, filters concerts from the year 2014 or later, groups by the `Stadium_ID` and aggregated fields, orders by the count of concerts in each stadium in descending order to get the stadium with the most concerts at the top, and limits the results to just the top row, which represents the stadium with the most number of concerts since 2014.

This query performs a left join between the `concert` and `singer_in_concert` tables on the `concert_ID` column and then groups the results by `concert_ID`, `concert_Name`, and `Theme` to ensure that concert information is correctly listed. The `COUNT(sic.Singer_ID)` function then counts the number of singers for each grouped concert. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that we include concerts that may not have any singers associated with them in the 'singer_in_concert' table.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .

Your SQL query should use columns name and singer_id.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 792
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list singer names and the number of concerts for each singer, we need to join the `singer` table and the `singer_in_concert` table and use the `COUNT` aggregate function to count the number of concerts per singer. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  COUNT(sic.concert_ID) as Number_of_Concerts
FROM
  singer s
LEFT JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
  s.Singer_ID
```

This query selects the singer's name from the `singer` table (`s.Name`) and counts the number of related concert IDs (`COUNT(sic.concert_ID)`) from the `singer_in_concert` table (`sic`). The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even singers who have not performed in any concerts will be included in the result with a concert count of zero. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the result by singer's ID (`s.Singer_ID`), as multiple rows in the `singer_in_concert` table can correspond to a single singer.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .

Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: To count the number of countries in each continent, you can use a SQL query that joins the `countries` table with the `continents` table and groups the results by the continent. Here's an SQL query that does just that:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent,

FROM 
    continents c
LEFT JOIN 
    countries co ON c.ContId = co.Continent
GROUP BY 
    c.ContId,
    c.Continent;
```

This query selects the `ContId` and `Continent` from the `continents` table and counts the number of `CountryId` entries from the `countries` table, grouping the results by `ContId`. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a continent has no countries, it will still appear in the list with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1031
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces based on the given schema, we can write an SQL query that joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table, and then count the number of unique model entries for each car maker. Here's the query that does just that:

```sql
SELECT cm.FullName, cm.Id, COUNT(ml.Model) as NumberOfModels 
FROM car_makers cm 
LEFT JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

Explanation:
- We select `FullName` and `Id` from the `car_makers` (aliased as cm) table, and count the number of models from the `model_list` (aliased as ml) table.
- We use a LEFT JOIN to include all car makers, even if they have zero models listed in the `model_list` table.
- COUNT(ml.Model) calculates the number of models associated with each car maker.
- GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName groups the results by each car maker's unique ID and full name.
- We name the count as NumberOfModels for better readability of the result set.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query should use columns fullname, id, and maker.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1033
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the full name of each car maker, along with its id and the count of how many models each produces, we need to perform a JOIN between the `car_makers` table and the `model_list` table, and then do a count on the models. Here's the query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT c.Id, c.FullName, COUNT(m.ModelId) as ModelCount
FROM car_makers c
LEFT JOIN model_list m ON c.Id = m.Maker
GROUP BY c.Id, c.FullName;
```

Here’s what this query is doing step-by-step:

1. We're selecting the `Id` and `FullName` columns from the `car_makers` table.
2. We perform a LEFT JOIN with the `model_list` table, matching each car maker with the models they produce based on the `Maker` foreign key in the `model_list` table.
3. We use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of models (`ModelId`) for each car maker.
4. Finally, we group the results by the car maker's `Id` and `FullName` so that we get the count of models for each unique car maker.

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a car maker doesn't have any models listed in the `model_list` table, it will still appear in the results with a model count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query should use columns model, makeid, id, and horsepower.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1025
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we can join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table on the `MakeId` and `Id` columns respectively. We then order the results by the `Horsepower` in ascending order and limit the results to 1 to get the entry with the minimum horsepower.

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id, cd.Horsepower
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower != 'NA' -- Exclude rows where horsepower is not available
ORDER BY CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER) ASC -- Casting horsepower to integer to sort numerically
LIMIT 1;
```

Please note that in the `cars_data` table, the `Horsepower` column type is TEXT, which means that it could possibly contain non-numeric values such as 'NA' (common notation for missing data in automotive datasets). In the WHERE clause, 'NA' values are being filtered out. Then, the `Horsepower` is cast to INTEGER to enable a numerical sort (ordering) since we're interested in the minimum numeric value. If the data is guaranteed to be clean and numeric, then the WHERE clause and casting can be omitted.

Remember that the actual column and data types, as well as the presence of any non-numeric values in numeric columns, should be taken into account when writing this query for a real-world dataset.

If there are no 'NA' values and the Horsepower column contains only numeric data as strings, you can simply use this query:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, cn.MakeId, cd.Id, cd.Horsepower
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
ORDER BY cd.Horsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the model of the car with the minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query should use colums model, makeid, id, and year.
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1028
