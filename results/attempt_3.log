PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, you would first need to calculate the average age of all singers, and then select the song names from those singers whose age is above this average. Here's the SQL query to accomplish this task:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query follows these steps:

1. Calculates the average age of all singers using a subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)`.
2. Compares each singer's age to the average age and selects those who are above the average.
3. Returns the `Song_Name` of those singers who meet the criteria.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 662
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `concert` and `stadium` tables based on the `Stadium_ID`, filter the concerts by the year, group by the stadium and count the number of concerts at each stadium. Then we can order by the count in descending order and limit the result to the stadium with the most concerts.

Here is the SQL query that would retrieve the required information:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will give you the name and capacity of the stadium that hosted the most concerts in 2014 or later. If the `Stadium_ID` field in the `concert` table is expected to be an integer, make sure data types are consistent between `concert` and `stadium` tables when performing joins; in such case, you may need to cast the values if they're not.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of stadiums without any concerts, we need to perform a LEFT JOIN between the stadium and concert tables and look for cases where there are no matching concert records for a given stadium. This can be accomplished with a SQL query that uses a LEFT JOIN along with a WHERE clause that checks for NULL values in a column that should have data if there was a concert associated with the stadium.

Here's an SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query will return the names of all stadiums that have no corresponding concert_ID in the concerts table, thus indicating that no concerts have been held in those stadiums.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To display the name and theme of all concerts along with the count of singers for each concert, we can use the following SQL query that performs a JOIN between the `concert` table and the `singer_in_concert` table and uses a COUNT aggregation on the linked singer IDs, grouped by the concert information:

```sql
SELECT
  c.concert_Name,
  c.Theme,

  c.concert_Name,
  c.Theme;
```

In this query:
- We are aliasing the `concert` table as `c` and the `singer_in_concert` table as `sic` for brevity.
- We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all concerts are shown, even those without any singers.
- We use COUNT(`sic`.`Singer_ID`) to get the number of singers in each concert.
- We GROUP BY `c`.`concert_ID`, `c`.`concert_Name`, and `c`.`Theme` to correctly aggregate the count by each individual concert.
- `NumberOfSingers` is the alias for the count of singers in each concert.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names along with the number of concerts each has performed in, you need to perform a JOIN operation between the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables and then group the result by the singers to count their concerts. Here is the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Number_of_Concerts
FROM singer s
JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query joins the two tables using the condition that the `Singer_ID` in the `singer` table matches the `Singer_ID` in the `singer_in_concert` table. It then groups the results by `Singer_ID` and counts the number of concerts for every singer. The `GROUP BY` clause is also applied to `s.Name` to ensure each singer's name appears in the result set, corresponding with each singer's aggregated concert count.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 668
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, you need to perform a selection on the `singer` table where the `Song_Name` column contains the word 'Hey'. Here's the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This SQL query uses the `LIKE` operator to find any song names that contain the word 'Hey', regardless of its position within the title. The `%` symbols are wildcard characters that match zero or more characters, which means that 'Hey' can appear at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the title. The query selects the `Name` and `Country` columns from entries that match the `LIKE` condition.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 454
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of pets owned by students that are older than 20, we need to perform the following actions:

1. Select students who are older than 20 from the `Student` table.
2. Join the resulting subset of students with the `Has_Pet` table to find all pets owned by these students.
3. Count the number of pets retrieved from the previous step.

Here is the SQL query to perform this action:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) AS NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet
ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query does the following:
- `JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID` joins the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on the student ID to find all pet ownership records for each student.
- `WHERE Student.Age > 20` filters the result set to only include students older than 20.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID)` counts the unique pet IDs. We use `DISTINCT` to avoid counting the same pet more than once if it appears in multiple rows.

Please execute this query on your database to get the actual count of pets owned by students older than 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 456
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, you will need to perform a JOIN between the Student and Has_Pet tables, and then another JOIN with the Pets table to get the pet type. Finally, you will use a WHERE clause to filter by female students and the pet type 'dog'. You would then use the COUNT() function to find the total number of dog pets:

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query joins the tables based on the relationships defined by the foreign keys and filters for female students (with `s.Sex = 'F'`) who have a dog (`p.PetType = 'dog'`). The COUNT(*) function then counts the number of resulting rows, which corresponds to the number of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the number of countries in each continent, you can run the following SQL query. It uses a JOIN to combine continent and country information, and then performs a GROUP BY to count the number of countries per continent:

```sql
SELECT 
    continents.ContId,
    continents.Continent,
    COUNT(countries.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM 
    continents
LEFT JOIN 
    countries ON continents.ContId = countries.Continent
GROUP BY 
    continents.ContId, continents.Continent
ORDER BY 
    NumberOfCountries DESC;
```

This query will list each continent's ID and name, along with the number of countries that belong to each continent. It uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure that even continents with no countries will be included in the result with a count of zero. If you don't wish to include continents with zero countries in the result, you can switch to an INNER JOIN. The results will be ordered by the number of countries in descending order.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 870
MODEL'S ANSWER: To determine how many models each car maker produces, we would join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on the `Id` from `car_makers` and `Maker` from `model_list`. After joining, we would use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by the car maker's ID, and then count the number of models for each group. Here's the query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
  cm.Id,
  cm.FullName,
  COUNT(ml.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
  car_makers cm
JOIN 
  model_list ml
ON 
  cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
  cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query selects the `Id` and `FullName` from the `car_makers` table (`cm` is the alias used), counts the number of `Model` entries from the `model_list` table (with alias `ml`), and groups the results by `car_makers.Id` and `car_makers.FullName`. The resulting output will list each maker's full name, ID, and the number of models they produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To provide the full name of each car maker, along with its ID and the count of models it produces, we will need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table and then perform a count on the number of models for each car maker. Here's the SQL query that does that:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id AS CarMakerId,
    cm.FullName AS CarMakerFullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query does the following:
- Selects the `Id` and `FullName` from the `car_makers` (aliased as `cm`) table.
- Performs a `LEFT JOIN` on the `model_list` (aliased as `ml`) table to include all car makers, even if they do not have any corresponding models (in which case the model count will be zero).
- Groups the results by `Id` and `FullName` to ensure we get a count of models for each distinct car maker.
- Counts the number of `ModelId` values from the `model_list` for each car maker to get the total number of models produced by each maker. The count function will return `0` for car makers with no corresponding models due to the `LEFT JOIN`.
  
After executing this query, you will get a list showing each car maker's ID, full name, and the count of models produced.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 861
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we'll need to join the `cars_data` and `model_list` tables on their respective key-columns, and then order the result by `Horsepower` in ascending order to determine the one with the minimum horsepower. 

Let's write that SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
    ml.Model, 
    cd.Horsepower
FROM 
    cars_data cd
JOIN 
    car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cn.Model = ml.Model
WHERE 
    cd.Horsepower NOT LIKE 'N/A' -- Exclude any non-numeric values of Horsepower
ORDER BY 
    CAST(cd.Horsepower as REAL), -- Ensure the values are sorted numerically
    ml.ModelId ASC -- If there are multiple models with the same minimum horsepower, we'll take the first one by ModelId
LIMIT 1;
```

Note that I have included a WHERE clause to exclude any non-numeric entries for `Horsepower` (e.g., 'N/A') which might be present in the table. Also, the Horsepower column is cast to REAL for correct numerical sorting, in case the column is stored as a TEXT or VARCHAR datatype. Finally, `LIMIT 1` ensures we only get the top record from our ordered list.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 863
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after 1980, you need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table on their IDs and then filter the results for the cars that were made after 1980. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query selects the unique (DISTINCT) car models (`cn.Model`) from the `car_names` table (`cn`) by joining with the `cars_data` table (`cd`) on the matching `MakeId` and `Id`, respectively, and filters the results to include only those cars with a `Year` value greater than 1980.
