TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 848
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to join the `stadium` and `concert` tables, count the number of concerts per stadium, and then find the stadium with the highest count. Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    s.Capacity

WHERE
    c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY

```

This query selects the stadium name and capacity, joins the `stadium` table with the `concert` table on the `Stadium_ID` field, filters the concerts for those that occurred in the year 2014 or later, groups the results by the `Stadium_ID`, orders them by the count of concerts in descending order, and returns the stadium with the highest number of concerts by using the `LIMIT 1` clause.

Since we want to count the number of singers for each concert, we will use GROUP BY on the `concert_id`.

Here's a query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT
  c.concert_Name,
  c.Theme,
  COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) AS Number_of_Singers
FROM
  concert AS c
LEFT JOIN
  singer_in_concert AS sic
ON
  c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY
  c.concert_ID, c.concert_Name, c.Theme;
```

In this query:
- `c` is the alias for the `concert` table.
- `sic` is the alias for the `singer_in_concert` table.
- We use LEFT JOIN to make sure we include all concerts, even if there are no singers associated with them (in such case, the count will be 0). 
- We use GROUP BY on `concert_ID`, `concert_Name`, and `Theme` to get a unique row for each concert.
- `COUNT(sic.Singer_ID)` counts the number of singer entries related to each concert (since we count only `Singer_ID`, NULLs are not counted, but thanks to LEFT JOIN we still include concerts with no singers).

MODEL'S ANSWER: To list singer names and the number of concerts for each singer, you can write a SQL query that joins the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and then groups by the singer's ID to count the number of concerts for each singer. Here's the query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) as Number_of_Concerts
FROM
    singer s
LEFT JOIN
    singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY
    s.Singer_ID;
```

This query will give you a list of singers with the tally of how many concerts they have been associated with, as recorded in the `singer_in_concert` table. The LEFT JOIN ensures that even if a singer has not performed in any concert, they will still be listed with a count of 0.

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. continents.contid
2. continents.continent
3. countries.continent
SQL:  select t1.contid ,  t1.continent ,  count(*) from continents as t1 
join countries as t2 on t1.contid  =  t2.continent group by t1.contid;
Your SQL query should use columns contid and continent.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1127
MODEL'S ANSWER: Certainly! You can list each continent along with the count of countries it contains by performing an INNER JOIN between the 'continents' table and the 'countries' table on their respective continent identifiers and then using the GROUP BY clause to aggregate the results per continent. The COUNT function will then be used to count the number of countries for each continent.

Here's the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT
    continents.ContId,
    continents.Continent,
    COUNT(countries.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM
    continents
JOIN
    countries ON continents.ContId = countries.Continent
GROUP BY
    continents.ContId, continents.Continent;
```

This query joins the continents and countries tables on their respective continent ids, groups the results by the continent ids and names, and then counts the number of country ids associated with each group (each continent).

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1070
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the number of models each car maker produces along with the maker's full name and ID, we can use the following SQL query that involves a JOIN operation between the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables, and a GROUP BY clause to count the number of models per maker:

```sql
SELECT 
    car_makers.Id,
    car_makers.FullName,
    COUNT(model_list.Model) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers
JOIN 
    model_list
ON 
    car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
    car_makers.Id, car_makers.FullName;
```

This query will give us a list of car makers along with their full name and ID, as well as the count of different models they produce.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_makers.fullname
2. car_makers.id
3. model_list.maker

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the full name of each car maker, along with its id and the number of models it produces, you would use SQL's GROUP BY and COUNT aggregate function. The query would join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table, group by the car maker's id and full name, and then count the number of models for each maker. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
  car_makers.Id,
  car_makers.FullName,
  COUNT(model_list.Maker) AS ModelCount
FROM 
  car_makers
LEFT JOIN model_list 
  ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker
GROUP BY 
  car_makers.Id, 
  car_makers.FullName;
```

This query selects the `Id` and `FullName` from the `car_makers` table and counts the number of models associated with each `Maker` in the `model_list` table. It groups the results by the `car_makers.Id` and `car_makers.FullName` to make sure that models are counted for each individual car maker. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that even if a maker has no models, it will still be included in the result with a model count of 0.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. car_names.model
2. car_names.makeid
3. cars_data.id
4. cars_data.horsepower

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1066
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we need to look into the `cars_data` table to find the lowest horsepower and then join this information with the `car_names` table to get the model of the car. We need to handle the cases where Horsepower might be represented as a text and could have some non-numeric values, which should be excluded from our search for the minimum horsepower.

Here is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
INNER JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower = (
  SELECT MIN(CAST(cd2.Horsepower AS INTEGER))
  FROM cars_data cd2
  WHERE cd2.Horsepower != 'NA' AND cd2.Horsepower != '' AND cd2.Horsepower IS NOT NULL
);
```

This query selects the model of the car by:
1. Joining `car_names` and `cars_data` on `MakeId` and `Id` accordingly.
2. The subquery is finding the minimum value of `Horsepower` from `cars_data` where `Horsepower` is not 'NA', not an empty string, and not `NULL`. Also casting the `Horsepower` as an INTEGER for correct comparison, assuming that all valid horsepower values are integer or can be casted to integer.
3. The main query is returning the `Model` from `car_names` where the `Horsepower` matches the minimum horsepower found.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?

Your SQL query may need to use the following list of columns (given in format <PARENT TABLE NAME>.<COLUMN NAME>, without the brackets):
1. model_list.model
2. car_names.model
3. car_names.makeid
4. cars_data.id
5. cars_data.year

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 1072
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the distinct car models that are produced after 1980, we can join the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables using the `makeid` and `id` columns, and then check the `year` column in `cars_data` for values greater than 1980. We will select the `model` column from the `car_names` table because it corresponds to the car make's model. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT car_names.Model
FROM car_names
JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id
WHERE cars_data.Year > 1980;
```

This query ensures that we are looking at unique models only once (`DISTINCT`) and filtering for those models for which at least one car was made after 1980 (`WHERE cars_data.Year > 1980`).
