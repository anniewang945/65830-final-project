PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers who are above the average age, you need to first calculate the average age of the singers from the `singer` table, and then select only those singers who have an age above the calculated average. After that, you need to list their song names. Here is the SQL query that performs these steps:

```sql
SELECT s.Song_Name
FROM singer s
WHERE s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query selects the `Song_Name` from the `singer` table (`s`) only for those singers whose `Age` is greater than the average `Age` calculated by a subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 662
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we can do the following steps:

1. Select concert events from the `concert` table that happened in the year 2014 or after.
2. Count the number of concerts for each stadium.
3. Join the results with the `stadium` table to get the name and capacity of the stadium.
4. Order the results by the number of concerts in descending order.
5. Limit the results to the top row to get just the stadium with the most concerts.

Here is a SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, s.Capacity
FROM stadium s
JOIN (
    SELECT c.Stadium_ID, COUNT(*) AS num_concerts
    FROM concert c
    WHERE c.Year >= '2014'
    GROUP BY c.Stadium_ID
) AS concert_counts ON s.Stadium_ID = concert_counts.Stadium_ID
ORDER BY concert_counts.num_concerts DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the `Name` and `Capacity` from the `stadium` table and counts the number of concerts for each stadium from the `concert` table, ensuring that only concerts from the year 2014 or after are counted. It orders the results in descending order by the `num_concerts` so that the stadium with the most concerts will be at the top, and limiting the result to just 1 row to get the stadium with the most concerts in the specified timeframe.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 654
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of stadiums without any concerts, we can use a `LEFT JOIN` between the `stadium` and `concert` tables on the `Stadium_ID` field and look for rows that have a `NULL` value in a field from the `concert` table (which implies that there is no corresponding concert for the stadium). We then select only unique stadium names.

Here's the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This SQL query will return a list of names of stadiums that did not host any concerts.

MODEL'S ANSWER: To list singer names along with the number of concerts each singer has performed in, you will need to join the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables and perform a count aggregation grouped by the singer. The SQL query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Name,
    COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS NumberOfConcerts
FROM 
    singer AS s
LEFT JOIN 
    singer_in_concert AS sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY 
    s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query selects the name of the singer and counts the number of concert IDs associated with each singer by joining the `singer` table (aliased as "s") and the `singer_in_concert` table (aliased as "sic") using the Singer_ID column. It groups the result by Singer_ID to ensure that it counts the concerts for each singer separately. Since we want to show all singers, even those who haven't performed in any concert, we use a `LEFT JOIN` which ensures that singers with zero concerts will also be included in the result, with 0 as their `NumberOfConcerts`.

Please note that we're also grouping by the singer's name (`s.Name`) to ensure compatibility with SQL standards, as some SQL databases require all non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list to be included in the GROUP BY clause.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 668
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey ' in its title, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey %';
```

This query will return all singers whose song names contain the substring 'Hey ' (with a space after 'Hey' to ensure the word is not part of another word). The '%' wildcard is used for pattern matching to allow for any characters to come before or after 'Hey '. If you want to catch cases like 'Hey' at the end of a song name or followed by punctuation instead of just a space, you might adjust the LIKE pattern accordingly.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 454
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students who are older than 20, we will need to join the `Student` table and the `Has_Pet` table on `StuID` and then count the distinct number of pets that fulfill this condition.

Here is the SQL query you would use to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) as NumberOfPets
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
WHERE s.Age > 20;
```

This query counts the distinct PetID entries from the `Has_Pet` table (to avoid counting the same pet more than once, in case of anomalies) where the corresponding student's age is greater than 20.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 456
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets raised by female students, we need to join the Student and Has_Pet tables based on `StuID` to filter out students with sex 'F', and then join the resultant set with the Pets table to filter out 'dog' pet types. The final step is to count the number of rows resulting from our query. Here is how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student AS s
JOIN Has_Pet AS hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets AS p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query counts the distinct pet IDs (`hp.PetID`) to avoid duplications in case a pet is somehow entered multiple times in the database. It first filters students by the sex column and then further filters pets by the pet type.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 872
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many countries each continent has, we would use a SQL query that involves a JOIN between the "continents" and "countries" tables, followed by an aggregation (COUNT) of countries per continent, grouped by the continent's id and name. Here is the query that provides this information:

```sql
SELECT continents.ContId, continents.Continent, COUNT(countries.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM continents
LEFT JOIN countries ON continents.ContId = countries.Continent
GROUP BY continents.ContId, continents.Continent
ORDER BY NumberOfCountries DESC;
```

This query selects the 'ContId' and 'Continent' columns from the 'continents' table and also counts the number of 'CountryId' entries from the 'countries' table. The 'LEFT JOIN' operation ensures that all continents are included in the result even if there are no corresponding countries (in which case the number of countries would be 0). The results are then grouped by 'ContId' and 'Continent', and finally, they are ordered by 'NumberOfCountries' in descending order to show the continents with the most countries at the top.

    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id;
```

This query breaks down as follows:
- We select the `Id` (aliased as `CarMakerId`) and `FullName` (aliased as `CarMakerFullName`) from the `car_makers` table.
- We use a `LEFT JOIN` with the `model_list` table to retrieve the associated models for each car maker.
- We then group the results by the car maker's ID (`cm.Id`) to allow for a count operation for each car maker.
- We use the `COUNT(ml.Model)` function to tally the number of models produced by each car maker, which is given the alias `NumberOfModels`. 

>Note: A `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that car makers with no models will still be included in the result with a model count of 0. If every car maker is guaranteed to have at least one model, an `INNER JOIN` could be used instead.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 861
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we first have to determine the minimum horsepower within the `cars_data` table. Then we need to identify the corresponding `MakeId` from that record and use it to find the related `Model` from the `car_names` table. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd
ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Horsepower = (
    SELECT MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER))
    FROM cars_data cd
    WHERE cd.Horsepower <> '' AND cd.Horsepower IS NOT NULL
);
```

This query might look complex because we need to make sure that we are only considering non-empty and valid `Horsepower` values. The `MIN` function will identify the smallest integer value of `Horsepower`, but we wrap `cd.Horsepower` with `CAST` to convert from text to an integer for accurate comparison, and we exclude rows where `Horsepower` is not set. Then we join `car_names` with `cars_data` to match the minimum horsepower car make ID and retrieve the corresponding `Model`.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 863
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve distinct car models produced after 1980, we need to join the `cars_data` table with the `car_names` table, since the `cars_data` table contains the information about the year when the car was created. We will filter the results for the year greater than 1980 and use `DISTINCT` to get unique model names.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This will give us a list of distinct car models that were produced after the year 1980.
