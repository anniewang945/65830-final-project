System knowledge: Given the following information, your job is to write SQL queries given a user’s request.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

Testing prompt 7:
Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1280

Model's answer:
To address this user request, we'll perform the following steps:

1. Identify the average "total_ons" for all Orange Line stations in Fall 2018, during time_period_01, and in the direction of 0.
2. Select the station names and "total_ons" values for stations on the Orange Line that exceed this average.
3. Sort the results by "total_ons" in descending order and then by station_name in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query that encompasses all these steps:

```sql
WITH AverageOrangeLineOns AS (
    SELECT AVG(total_ons) AS avg_ons
    FROM rail_ridership
    WHERE season = 'Fall 2018'
    AND line_id = 'orange'
    AND time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
    AND direction = 0
),
OrangeLineStationsAboveAverage AS (
    SELECT rr.station_id, rr.total_ons
    FROM rail_ridership rr, AverageOrangeLineOns ao
    WHERE rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
    AND rr.line_id = 'orange'
    AND rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
    AND rr.direction = 0
    AND rr.total_ons > ao.avg_ons
)
SELECT s.station_name, olsa.total_ons
FROM OrangeLineStationsAboveAverage olsa
JOIN stations s ON olsa.station_id = s.station_id
ORDER BY olsa.total_ons DESC, s.station_name ASC;
```

This query uses two common table expressions (CTEs). The first one (AverageOrangeLineOns) calculates the average "total_ons" for the criteria specified. The second one (OrangeLineStationsAboveAverage) retrieves the stations with "total_ons" above that average. These are then joined with the stations table to get the station names and sorted as requested.

Testing prompt 7:
Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1280

Model's answer:
To address this request, we need to:

1. Identify `time_period_01` in `Fall 2018` for the `Orange Line` where the direction is `0`.
2. Compute the average `total_ons` for all `Orange Line` stations during this time period and season.
3. Then, retrieve every station name from the `stations` table where their `total_ons` is above this average.
4. Finally, sort the results by `total_ons` in descending order and `station_name` in ascending order.

Here is the SQL query for the above steps:

```sql
WITH OrangeLineAverage AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(rr.total_ons) AS average_total_ons
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
        JOIN lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id
    WHERE
        l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
        AND rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
        AND rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
        AND rr.direction = 0
)
SELECT
    st.station_name,
    rr.total_ons
FROM
    rail_ridership rr
    JOIN stations st ON rr.station_id = st.station_id
    JOIN lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id,
    OrangeLineAverage
WHERE
    l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
    AND rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
    AND rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
    AND rr.direction = 0
    AND rr.total_ons > OrangeLineAverage.average_total_ons
ORDER BY
    rr.total_ons DESC,
    st.station_name ASC;
```

In this query, the Common Table Expression (CTE) `OrangeLineAverage` computes the average total ons for the specific criteria. Then, we join the necessary tables `stations`, `rail_ridership`, and `lines` to select the station names and total on passenger count, filtering out those that are above the computed average. We apply the required ORDER BY clause to sort the results as required.

Please replace the table and column names if they are different in the actual dataset. Additionally, you might need to adjust the order by clause if the database's default sorting behavior for NULL values is not as desired.

Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1280

Model's answer:
To accomplish this task, we need to perform a couple of steps:

1. Identify 'time_period_01' for the specified 'day_type', 'season' with a 'direction' of 0 for the Orange Line during Fall 2018.
2. Calculate the average 'total_ons' for all Orange Line stations during time_period_01 for Fall 2018 in the specified direction.
3. Select the station names and corresponding 'total_ons' that are greater than the average calculated in step 2.

We can use the following SQL query:

```sql
WITH OrangeLineAverage AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(rr.total_ons) AS avg_total_ons
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    WHERE
        rr.line_id = 'orange' AND
        rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01' AND
        rr.season = 'Fall 2018' AND
        rr.direction = 0
)
SELECT
    s.station_name,
    rr.total_ons
FROM
    rail_ridership rr
JOIN
    stations s ON rr.station_id = s.station_id
JOIN
    OrangeLineAverage ON rr.total_ons > OrangeLineAverage.avg_total_ons
WHERE
    rr.line_id = 'orange' AND
    rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01' AND
    rr.season = 'Fall 2018' AND
    rr.direction = 0
ORDER BY
    rr.total_ons DESC,
    s.station_name ASC;
```

Explanation:

- We use a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `OrangeLineAverage` to calculate the average `total_ons` for the Orange Line during the specified conditions.
- We then perform a `JOIN` between the `rail_ridership` table and the `stations` table to get the station names, and also a `JOIN` on our CTE to filter for stations where `total_ons` is greater than the average.
- Finally, we add `ORDER BY` to sort the results first by `total_ons` in descending order and then by `station_name` in ascending order, as the user requested.

Please make sure to execute this SQL query against the appropriate database that contains the dataset. The column names and data structure provided in the user's request are assumed to be correct.
