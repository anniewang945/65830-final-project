System knowledge: Given the following information, your job is to write SQL queries given a user’s request.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

Find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station. Report the station ID, route ID, and distance (in miles) to the previous station, sorted by decreasing distance. Break ties in distance by sorting by route ID and then station ID, both in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1254

Model's answer:
To find all the stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station and report their station ID, route ID, and distance to the previous station, we can perform a `SELECT` query on the `station_orders` table with a `WHERE` clause to filter out the appropriate records. We will then sort the results by decreasing distance, and in case of ties, we will sort by route ID and then station ID in ascending order, as follows:

```sql
SELECT station_id, route_id, distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM station_orders
WHERE distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1
ORDER BY distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, route_id ASC, station_id ASC;
```

This SQL query will give us a list of all stations that are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, sorted according to the criteria specified.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1254

Model's answer:
To find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, you can use a `SELECT` statement in SQL that filters the `distance_from_last_station_miles` column in the `station_orders` table on the condition that the distance is greater than or equal to 1. You can then sort the results by decreasing distance, breaking ties in distance by sorting by route ID and then station ID, both in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    station_id,
    route_id,
    distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM 
    station_orders
WHERE 
    distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1.0
ORDER BY 
    distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, 
    route_id ASC, 
    station_id ASC;
```

This query selects the necessary columns from the `station_orders` table where the `distance_from_last_station_miles` is at least 1 mile. The `ORDER BY` clause first sorts the results in decreasing order of distance, and in case of ties, it further sorts by `route_id` and `station_id` in ascending order, as requested.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1254

Model's answer:
To find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, we can use the following SQL query. This query will select the `station_id`, `route_id`, and `distance_from_last_station_miles` from the `station_orders` table where the distance is greater than or equal to 1 mile. The results will be ordered by `distance_from_last_station_miles` in descending order (to get the stations with the largest distance first), and then by `route_id` and `station_id` in ascending order to break the ties.

```sql
SELECT station_id, route_id, distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM station_orders
WHERE distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1
ORDER BY distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, route_id ASC, station_id ASC;
```

This will provide a list of all stations that meet the criteria, sorted appropriately.
