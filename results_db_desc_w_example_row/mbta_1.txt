System knowledge: Given the following information, your job is to write SQL queries given a user’s request.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).
The SQL table schemas of the database are shown below with an example row from each table.

Testing prompt 1:
Find the first and last station for each route on each line. Report the line name, route direction name, and first and last station name. Sort the results by the line name, direction name, first station name, and then last station name, all in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1250

Model's answer:
To produce the desired results, we need to join multiple tables: `lines`, `routes`, `stations`, and `station_orders`. Here's the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
  l.line_name,
  r.direction_desc,
  fs.station_name AS first_station_name,
  ls.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM 
  routes r
JOIN 
  lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN 
  stations fs ON r.first_station_id = fs.station_id
JOIN 
  stations ls ON r.last_station_id = ls.station_id
ORDER BY 
  l.line_name ASC,
  r.direction_desc ASC,
  fs.station_name ASC,
  ls.station_name ASC;
```

This SQL statement does the following:
- Joins the `routes` table with the `lines` table on the `line_id` to get the name of the line.
- Joins the `routes` table with the `stations` table twice: once for the first station (`fs`) and once for the last station (`ls`), using the `first_station_id` and `last_station_id` respectively.
- Selects the line name (`line_name`), the route's direction description (`direction_desc`), and the names of the first and last stations.
- Orders the result set by `line_name`, `direction_desc`, `first_station_name`, and `last_station_name` in ascending order as requested.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1250

Model's answer:
To find the first and last station for each route on each line, we need to join the `lines`, `routes`, and `stations` tables. We then select the appropriate columns, and order the result according to the specified criteria. Here's the query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
  l.line_name,
  r.direction_desc,
  fs.station_name AS first_station_name,
  ls.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM
  routes r
JOIN
  lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN
  stations fs ON r.first_station_id = fs.station_id
JOIN
  stations ls ON r.last_station_id = ls.station_id
ORDER BY
  l.line_name ASC,
  r.direction_desc ASC,
  fs.station_name ASC,
  ls.station_name ASC;
```

This SQL query performs the following actions:
1. JOINs the `routes` table with the `lines` table using the `line_id` to get the line names.
2. JOINs the `routes` table with the `stations` table twice, once for the `first_station_id` and once for the `last_station_id`, to retrieve the names of the first and last stations for each route.
3. SELECTs the `line_name`, `direction_desc`, the name of the first station (`first_station_name`), and the name of the last station (`last_station_name`).
4. Finally, ORDERs the results by `line_name`, `direction_desc`, `first_station_name`, and `last_station_name`, all in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1250

Model's answer:
To find the first and last station for each route on each line and report the line name, route direction name, first and last station name, we need to join the `lines`, `routes`, and `stations` tables. We'll join the `lines` table with `routes` on `line_id`, `routes` with `stations` twice, first on `first_station_id`, and second on `last_station_id`. After that, we'll select the required columns and order the results.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  l.line_name,
  r.direction_desc,
  s1.station_name AS first_station_name,
  s2.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM
  routes r
JOIN
  lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN
  stations s1 ON r.first_station_id = s1.station_id
JOIN
  stations s2 ON r.last_station_id = s2.station_id
ORDER BY
  l.line_name ASC,
  r.direction_desc ASC,
  s1.station_name ASC,
  s2.station_name ASC;
```

This query will return the line name, the direction description, and the names of the first and last stations for each route. The results will be sorted as requested.
