System knowledge: Given the following information, your job is to write SQL queries given a user’s request.
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).

Testing prompt 9:
For each line, in the Fall 2019 season, find the station with “maximally bypassed ratio”. That is, the station “s” that has the largest ratio “(a - b)/a”, where “a” is the the sum of average_flow values for all time periods and all directions of “s” and “b” is the total sum of: the sum of its average_ons and sum of its average_offs values. Therefore, the ratio “(a - b)/a” represents the proportion of people who bypassed one station. Report the station name, its line name, and its bypassed ratio. Sort the results by line name in ascending order. HINT: You may need to use function CAST(total_flow AS REAL) to cast the summation of flows (i.e. “a” above) to real number.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1372

Model's answer:
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Sum the `average_flow`, `average_ons`, and `average_offs` for each station, for each line in the Fall 2019 season for all time periods and directions.
2. Compute the "maximally bypassed ratio" for each station as defined.
3. Find the station with the largest ratio for each line.
4. Join the results with the `lines` and `stations` tables to get the line names and station names.
5. Sort the final result by line name in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH FlowData AS (
  SELECT
    rr.station_id,
    rr.line_id,
    SUM(CAST(rr.average_flow AS REAL)) AS total_flow,
    SUM(rr.average_ons) AS sum_ons,
    SUM(rr.average_offs) AS sum_offs
  FROM
    rail_ridership rr
  WHERE
    rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
  GROUP BY
    rr.station_id, rr.line_id
),
BypassRatios AS (
  SELECT
    fd.station_id,
    fd.line_id,
    (fd.total_flow - (fd.sum_ons + fd.sum_offs)) / fd.total_flow AS bypassed_ratio
  FROM
    FlowData fd
)
, MaxBypassedRatios AS (
  SELECT
    br.line_id,
    MAX(br.bypassed_ratio) AS max_bypassed_ratio
  FROM
    BypassRatios br
  GROUP BY
    br.line_id
)
, LineMaxBypassedStations AS (
  SELECT
    br.station_id,
    br.line_id,
    br.bypassed_ratio
  FROM
    BypassRatios br
  INNER JOIN MaxBypassedRatios mbr
    ON br.line_id = mbr.line_id
    AND br.bypassed_ratio = mbr.max_bypassed_ratio
)
SELECT
  st.station_name,
  ln.line_name,
  lmbs.bypassed_ratio
FROM
  LineMaxBypassedStations lmbs
INNER JOIN stations st
  ON lmbs.station_id = st.station_id
INNER JOIN lines ln
  ON lmbs.line_id = ln.line_id
ORDER BY
  ln.line_name ASC;
```

This query defines several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability and to break down the process:

- `FlowData`: This CTE calculates the sum of `average_flow`, `average_ons`, and `average_offs` for each station and line for the Fall 2019 season.
- `BypassRatios`: Here, we calculate the bypassed ratio for each station and line.
- `MaxBypassedRatios`: This CTE finds the maximum bypassed ratio for each line.
- `LineMaxBypassedStations`: We then identify stations that have the maximum bypassed ratio for their respective lines.

Finally, we join the `LineMaxBypassedStations` results with the `stations` and `lines` tables to obtain the station names and line names, and we sort the results by line name in ascending order to display the requested output.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1372

Model's answer:
To find the station with the maximally bypassed ratio for each line in the Fall 2019 season, we need to calculate the sum of average_flow (`a`), sum of average_ons, and sum of average_offs (`b`) for each station and then compute the ratio `(a - b)/a`. Afterward, we will determine the maximum of these ratios for each line and present the results along with the station name and line name, sorted by the line name in ascending order.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH StationRatios AS (
    SELECT
        rr.station_id,
        rr.line_id,
        SUM(rr.average_flow) AS total_flow,

        SUM(rr.average_offs) AS total_offs
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    WHERE
        rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY
        rr.station_id,
        rr.line_id
),
RatiosWithNames AS (
    SELECT
        sr.station_id,
        l.line_name,
        s.station_name,
        (CAST(total_flow AS REAL) - (total_ons + total_offs)) / CAST(total_flow AS REAL) AS ratio
    FROM
        StationRatios sr
    JOIN stations s ON sr.station_id = s.station_id
    JOIN lines l ON sr.line_id = l.line_id
)

SELECT
    DISTINCT ON (l.line_name)
    l.line_name, 
    s.station_name, 
    R.ratio AS bypassed_ratio
FROM
    RatiosWithNames R
JOIN lines l ON R.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN stations s ON R.station_id = s.station_id
WHERE
    R.ratio IS NOT NULL AND R.ratio > 0 -- to make sure the ratio makes sense and avoiding division by zero
ORDER BY
    l.line_name ASC,
    R.ratio DESC; -- this order by will make sure the station with maximally bypassed ratio comes first for each line with DISTINCT ON
```

This query goes through the following steps:
1. Calculate `total_flow`, `total_ons`, and `total_offs` for each station and line for the Fall 2019 season.
2. Join the calculated table with `stations` and `lines` to get the station names and line names.
3. Calculate the bypassed ratio, making sure to cast `total_flow` to `REAL` to ensure floating-point division.
4. For each line, select the station name and ratio with the highest ratio value, ensuring the ratios make sense and are positive.
5. Sort the final result by line name in ascending order, with the maximum ratio first, using the DISTINCT ON feature to only get the first entry per line group. 

Keep in mind that the DISTINCT ON clause is a PostgreSQL specific extension and may not work in other SQL database systems. If you are using a different SQL system, you would have to use another technique to get the maximum value per group (like a correlated subquery or a window function).

Testing prompt 9:
For each line, in the Fall 2019 season, find the station with “maximally bypassed ratio”. That is, the station “s” that has the largest ratio “(a - b)/a”, where “a” is the the sum of average_flow values for all time periods and all directions of “s” and “b” is the total sum of: the sum of its average_ons and sum of its average_offs values. Therefore, the ratio “(a - b)/a” represents the proportion of people who bypassed one station. Report the station name, its line name, and its bypassed ratio. Sort the results by line name in ascending order. HINT: You may need to use function CAST(total_flow AS REAL) to cast the summation of flows (i.e. “a” above) to real number.

Model's answer:
To find the "maximally bypassed ratio" for each line in the Fall 2019 season, we will need to perform the following steps in SQL:

1. Calculate `a` for each station: the sum of `average_flow` values for all time periods and both directions in the Fall 2019 season.
2. Calculate `b` for each station: the sum of `average_ons` and `average_offs` for all time periods and both directions in the Fall 2019 season.
3. Calculate the ratio `(a - b)/a` for each station.
4. Identify the station with the highest ratio for each line.
5. Join the results with the `lines` and `stations` tables to get the line name and station name.
6. Sort the results by line name in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH StationFlows AS (
    SELECT
        rr.line_id,
        rr.station_id,
        SUM(CAST(rr.average_flow AS REAL)) AS sum_average_flow,
        SUM(CAST(rr.average_ons + rr.average_offs AS REAL)) AS sum_average_ons_offs
    FROM rail_ridership rr
    WHERE rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY rr.line_id, rr.station_id
),
BypassRatios AS (
    SELECT
        sf.line_id,
        sf.station_id,
        (sf.sum_average_flow - sf.sum_average_ons_offs) / sf.sum_average_flow AS bypassed_ratio
    FROM StationFlows sf
)
, MaxBypassedRatios AS (
    SELECT
        br.line_id,
        MAX(br.bypassed_ratio) AS max_bypassed_ratio
    FROM BypassRatios br
    GROUP BY br.line_id
)
SELECT
    st.station_name AS station_name,
    li.line_name AS line_name,
    br.bypassed_ratio
FROM BypassRatios br
INNER JOIN MaxBypassedRatios mbr ON br.line_id = mbr.line_id AND br.bypassed_ratio = mbr.max_bypassed_ratio
INNER JOIN lines li ON br.line_id = li.line_id
INNER JOIN stations st ON br.station_id = st.station_id
ORDER BY li.line_name ASC;
```

The query starts by creating a common table expression (CTE) `StationFlows` to sum the average flows (`a`) and the average on-offs (`b`) for each station within each line. It then calculates the bypass ratio.

Next, we define the `BypassRatios` CTE to compute the bypass ratio for each station. Then, we define the `MaxBypassedRatios` CTE to find the maximum bypass ratio for each line.

Finally, we join these CTEs with the `lines` and `stations` tables to obtain the required line and station names and filter out the stations with the maximum bypass ratio for each line. We then present the results sorted by line name.
