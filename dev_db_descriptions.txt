db_id: mbta
The dataset is derived using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s (MBTA) Open Data Portal. This dataset includes information about the MBTA’s subway lines (e.g. lines, stations, ridership, etc.).
The database tables include:
lines: contains the ID and name of each T rail line in the dataset. Note that the Silver Line is not included.
routes: details the different rail routes that operate on the lines; for example, the Red Line has one route which services Braintree to Alewife and another distinct route which services Ashmont to Alewife. The table contains a unique route ID, the route name, the ID of the line it belongs to, the IDs of the first and last stations of that route, and the direction, given in a binary field and a string description.
stations: contains the ID and name of each T station in the dataset. Note that this stations list is a snapshot of the past (to be specific, June 2020); newly opened stations, such as the Union Square station, are not included, and vintage stations, such as the BU West station, are included.
station_orders: describes the order of stations along each route. The table contains a route ID, station ID, number in the order of that route, and distance (in miles) from the previous station to the current station. Note that all initial stations of each route have a set distance of 0 since there is no previous station. In addition, all Green Line distances are set to NULL since the MBTA did not provide a complete dataset in this case.
gated_station_entries: contains the number of people entering the gates of each station in half-hour increments. The table contains the service date and time, station and line IDs (some stations have gates for multiple lines; e.g. Downtown Crossing is a station on both the Red and Orange lines), and number of entries. Note that the number of gated entries are sometimes not whole numbers in the table; if you aggregate over multiple lines on the same station most should sum to a whole number (except for stations which exist on the Silver Line, like South Station).
rail_ridership: includes ridership trends for Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019 over various time slices of the week. The table contains the season (i.e. “Fall 2017”), line ID, direction, time period ID, and station ID as the primary key; further, we have the total number of people who got on the train, the total number of people who got off the train, the number of non-holiday days in operation during that portion of the season, the average number of people who got on the train per operating day, the average number of people who got off the train per operating day, and the average flow, or number of people who were in the train or boarded or disembarked at that station.
time_periods: identifies time slices of the week used to interpret rail ridership patterns. The table contains an ID for each time period (e.g., time_period_01), the type of day (e.g., weekday), a textual description of the time period (e.g., AM PEAK), and the start and end times for the time slice in 24 hour notation (e.g., 03:00:00).
