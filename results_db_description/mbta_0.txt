Find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station. Report the station ID, route ID, and distance (in miles) to the previous station, sorted by decreasing distance. Break ties in distance by sorting by route ID and then station ID, both in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1068

Model's answer:
To find all stations which are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, we need to select relevant data from the `station_orders` table and apply the required conditions and sorting. The SQL query for this task would be:

```sql
SELECT station_id, route_id, distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM station_orders
WHERE distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1
ORDER BY distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, route_id ASC, station_id ASC;
```

This query selects the `station_id`, `route_id`, and `distance_from_last_station_miles` from the `station_orders` table. It filters to only include records where the `distance_from_last_station_miles` is equal to or greater than 1. The results are then sorted in descending order by `distance_from_last_station_miles`, and ties are resolved by sorting by `route_id` and `station_id` in ascending order as specified.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1068

Model's answer:
To find all the stations that are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, we can query the `station_orders` table, filter the results by the `distance_from_last_station_miles` field to be greater than or equal to 1, and then order the results by the distance in decreasing order. If there are ties in the distance, we then order by the `route_id` and next by `station_id`, both in ascending order. Here's the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT station_id, route_id, distance_from_last_station_miles
FROM station_orders
WHERE distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1
ORDER BY distance_from_last_station_miles DESC, route_id, station_id;
```

This query will produce a list of stations that meet the specified criteria along with the route ID and the distance to the previous station.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1068

Model's answer:
To find all stations that are at least 1 mile away from the previous station, we need to filter the `station_orders` table based on the `distance_from_last_station_miles` being greater than or equal to 1. Then, we should sort the results by decreasing distance, and in case of ties, sort by `route_id` and `station_id` in ascending order. Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    station_id, 
    route_id, 
    distance_from_last_station_miles 
FROM 
    station_orders 
WHERE 
    distance_from_last_station_miles >= 1 
ORDER BY 
    distance_from_last_station_miles DESC,
    route_id ASC,
    station_id ASC;
``` 

This query will output a list of station IDs, route IDs, and distances from the previous station where the distance is at least 1 mile, sorted according to the specified criteria.
