Testing prompt 7:
Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1094

Model's answer:
To achieve this, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the average number of `total_ons` for all Orange Line stations during `time_period_01` in `Fall 2018` and in the `direction` of 0.
2. Find each Orange Line station during `time_period_01` in `Fall 2018` and in the `direction` of 0 with a `total_ons` passenger count greater than the average calculated above.
3. Return the name of these stations and their `total_ons` value.
4. Sort the resulting set by `total_ons` in descending order and then by station name in ascending order.

Here's how the SQL query would look like:

```sql
WITH AverageOns AS (
  SELECT AVG(rr.total_ons) as avg_total_ons
  FROM rail_ridership rr
  INNER JOIN lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id
  WHERE rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
  AND rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
  AND rr.direction = 0
  AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
)

SELECT s.station_name, rr.total_ons
FROM rail_ridership rr
INNER JOIN lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id
INNER JOIN stations s ON rr.station_id = s.station_id,
AverageOns ao
WHERE rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
AND rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
AND rr.direction = 0
AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
AND rr.total_ons > ao.avg_total_ons
ORDER BY rr.total_ons DESC, s.station_name ASC;
```

Explanation of the Query:
- The `WITH` clause is used to create a temporary table (CTE - common table expression) called `AverageOns` that calculates the average of `total_ons` for all the Orange Line stations for the specified condition.
- The main `SELECT` query joins the `rail_ridership`, `lines`, and `stations` tables to get the `total_ons` values along with matching station names, considering only the Orange Line (`line_name = 'Orange Line'`), specific season (`'Fall 2018'`), time period (`'time_period_01'`), and direction (`0`).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for only those stations with `total_ons` greater than the average calculated in the CTE.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results first in descending order by `total_ons` and then in ascending order by `station_name`.

Testing prompt 7:
Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1094

Model's answer:
To retrieve the stations fulfilling the criteria, we first need to determine the average number of passengers getting on (total_ons) at all Orange Line stations during Fall 2018, in time_period_01, and in direction 0. We then need to compare this value against individual station values.

Here's how we can do this with an SQL query:

```sql
WITH OrangeLineAvg AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(rr.total_ons) AS average_total_ons
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    INNER JOIN
        lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id
    WHERE
        rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
        AND rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
        AND rr.direction = 0
        AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
)
SELECT
    s.station_name,
    rr.total_ons
FROM
    rail_ridership rr
INNER JOIN
    stations s ON rr.station_id = s.station_id
INNER JOIN
    lines l ON rr.line_id = l.line_id
CROSS JOIN
    OrangeLineAvg ola
WHERE
    rr.season = 'Fall 2018'
    AND rr.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
    AND rr.direction = 0
    AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
    AND rr.total_ons > ola.average_total_ons
ORDER BY
    rr.total_ons DESC,
    s.station_name ASC;
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. In a common table expression (CTE) named `OrangeLineAvg`, the average `total_ons` for the Orange Line during the specified conditions is calculated.
2. In the main query:
   - We join the `rail_ridership` table with the `stations` and `lines` tables to get the station names for the Orange Line.
   - We use the average `total_ons` from our `OrangeLineAvg` CTE as a threshold for comparison.
   - We only select records that match the conditions given by your request: Fall 2018, time_period_01, direction 0, and for the Orange Line.
   - Then we filter out the stations where `total_ons` is greater than the computed average value.
3. The results are ordered by `total_ons` in descending order and station names in ascending order.

Testing prompt 7:
Find every Orange Line station in Fall 2018 that, during time_period_01 and the direction of 0, had a total_ons passenger count that was greater than average for all Orange Line stations at that same time period, same season, and in the same direction. Report the station name and the total_ons value. Sort the results by total_ons in descending order and then station name in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1094

Model's answer:
To solve this request, we need to:

1. Identify the `time_period_id` that corresponds to `time_period_01`.
2. Determine the average of `total_ons` for all Orange Line stations during `time_period_01` in Fall 2018 and direction 0.
3. Select all stations with a `total_ons` greater than this calculated average.
4. Join necessary tables to get the station names and relevant data.
5. Sort the resulting stations by `total_ons` in descending order and then by station name in ascending order.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH orange_line_avg AS (
  SELECT AVG(r.total_ons) as avg_ons
  FROM rail_ridership r
  JOIN lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
  WHERE r.season = 'Fall 2018' 
    AND r.time_period_id = 'time_period_01' 
    AND r.direction = 0
    AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
)
SELECT s.station_name, r.total_ons
FROM rail_ridership r
JOIN lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN stations s ON r.station_id = s.station_id, orange_line_avg
WHERE r.season = 'Fall 2018'
  AND r.time_period_id = 'time_period_01'
  AND r.direction = 0
  AND l.line_name = 'Orange Line'
  AND r.total_ons > orange_line_avg.avg_ons
ORDER BY r.total_ons DESC, s.station_name ASC;
```

Explanation:

- The first part of the query creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `orange_line_avg` to calculate the average `total_ons` for all Orange Line stations during the specified conditions.
- We then select the required fields (`station_name` and `total_ons`) and join the `rail_ridership`, `lines`, and `stations` tables to retrieve station names.
- The `WHERE` clause filters records to match the specified season, time period, direction, and line name. It also filters out results where `total_ons` is less than or equal to the average.
- Finally, we sort the results according to the requested criteria.

Execution of this query will return each Orange Line station with higher than average `total_ons` during the particular constraints, ordered by `total_ons` descending and `station_name` ascending as requested.
