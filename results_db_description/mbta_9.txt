Testing prompt 9:
For each line, in the Fall 2019 season, find the station with “maximally bypassed ratio”. That is, the station “s” that has the largest ratio “(a - b)/a”, where “a” is the the sum of average_flow values for all time periods and all directions of “s” and “b” is the total sum of: the sum of its average_ons and sum of its average_offs values. Therefore, the ratio “(a - b)/a” represents the proportion of people who bypassed one station. Report the station name, its line name, and its bypassed ratio. Sort the results by line name in ascending order. HINT: You may need to use function CAST(total_flow AS REAL) to cast the summation of flows (i.e. “a” above) to real number.

Model's answer:
To find the station with the maximally bypassed ratio per line, we first need to calculate "a" and "b" for each station in the 'Fall 2019' season, and then compute the ratio "(a - b) / a" for each station. We then find the station with the maximum ratio for each line.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this task:

```sql
WITH StationRatios AS (
    SELECT
        rr.station_id,
        l.line_name,
        l.line_id,
        (SUM(rr.average_flow) - CAST(SUM(rr.average_ons + rr.average_offs) AS REAL)) / CAST(SUM(rr.average_flow) AS REAL) AS bypassed_ratio
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    INNER JOIN lines l ON
        rr.line_id = l.line_id
    WHERE
        rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY
        rr.station_id, l.line_name, l.line_id
),
MaxRatios AS (
    SELECT
        line_id,
        MAX(bypassed_ratio) AS max_ratio
    FROM
        StationRatios
    GROUP BY
        line_id
)
SELECT
    s.station_name,
    sr.line_name,
    sr.bypassed_ratio
FROM
    StationRatios sr
INNER JOIN MaxRatios mr ON
    sr.line_id = mr.line_id AND sr.bypassed_ratio = mr.max_ratio
INNER JOIN stations s ON
    sr.station_id = s.station_id
ORDER BY
    sr.line_name ASC;
```

In this query:

1. The `StationRatios` Common Table Expression (CTE) computes the bypassed_ratio calculation for each station and line. It uses `CAST` to ensure correct division for the ratio.

2. The `MaxRatios` CTE identifies the maximum bypass ratio for each line.

3. The final query joins `StationRatios` with the `MaxRatios` to filter out the stations that have the highest ratio per line.

4. It then joins with the `stations` table to get the station names.

5. The results are ordered by `line_name` in ascending order.

Testing prompt 9:
For each line, in the Fall 2019 season, find the station with “maximally bypassed ratio”. That is, the station “s” that has the largest ratio “(a - b)/a”, where “a” is the the sum of average_flow values for all time periods and all directions of “s” and “b” is the total sum of: the sum of its average_ons and sum of its average_offs values. Therefore, the ratio “(a - b)/a” represents the proportion of people who bypassed one station. Report the station name, its line name, and its bypassed ratio. Sort the results by line name in ascending order. HINT: You may need to use function CAST(total_flow AS REAL) to cast the summation of flows (i.e. “a” above) to real number.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1186

Model's answer:
To solve this, we first need to calculate the bypass ratio for each station and line. The bypass ratio is given by `(a - b) / a`, where `a` is the sum of `average_flow` values for all time periods and all directions of the station, and `b` is the total sum of `average_ons` and `average_offs` values.

We will:
1. Calculate `a` as the sum of `average_flow` for each station on the line during Fall 2019.
2. Calculate `b` as the sum of `average_ons` and `average_offs` for the same.
3. Calculate the ratio as `(a - b) / a` using a subquery or CTE.
4. Join this with the `stations` and `lines` tables to get the station and line names.
5. Order by the line name.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
WITH BypassRatios AS (
    SELECT
        rr.line_id,
        rr.station_id,
        SUM(CAST(rr.average_flow AS REAL)) AS sum_average_flow,
        SUM(rr.average_ons + rr.average_offs) AS sum_ons_offs
    FROM
        rail_ridership rr
    WHERE
        rr.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY
        rr.line_id, rr.station_id
), BypassRatiosWithNames AS (
    SELECT
        l.line_name,
        s.station_name,
        br.line_id,
        br.station_id,
        (br.sum_average_flow - br.sum_ons_offs) / br.sum_average_flow AS bypass_ratio
    FROM
        BypassRatios br
        JOIN stations s ON br.station_id = s.station_id
        JOIN lines l ON br.line_id = l.line_id
)

SELECT
    station_name,
    line_name,
    MAX(bypass_ratio) AS maximally_bypassed_ratio
FROM
    BypassRatiosWithNames
GROUP BY
    line_name, station_name
ORDER BY
    line_name ASC, maximally_bypassed_ratio DESC;
```

Please note that:
- We are casting the flow to `REAL` as mentioned in the hint.
- Since multiple stations on a single line might have the exact bypass ratio, the query may return more than one station per line with the maximum ratio. If you want to limit this to just one, you can use a more complex query that ranks the results and filters on the rank. However, the provided instructions don't explicitly demand a single station per line.
- Depending on your SQL implementation (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), the function for casting may differ (`CAST` in the query above is standard SQL), and if the environment allows it, you might need to handle division by zero cases when `a` is zero.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1186

Model's answer:
To find the "maximally bypassed ratio" for each line, we first need to sum up the `average_flow`, `average_ons`, and `average_offs` for each station across all time periods and directions for the Fall 2019 season. Once we have these sums, we can compute the desired ratio. Finally, we'll find the station with the largest "bypassed ratio" for each line, and sort the results by the line name.

Here's the SQL query we can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    line_name,
    station_name,
    (station_flow - (total_ons + total_offs)) / station_flow AS bypassed_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT
        l.line_name,
        s.station_name,
        CAST(SUM(r.average_flow) AS REAL) AS station_flow,
        SUM(r.average_ons) AS total_ons,
        SUM(r.average_offs) AS total_offs,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l.line_id ORDER BY (SUM(r.average_flow) - (SUM(r.average_ons) + SUM(r.average_offs))) / CAST(SUM(r.average_flow) AS REAL) DESC) AS rn
    FROM rail_ridership r
    JOIN lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
    JOIN stations s ON r.station_id = s.station_id
    WHERE r.season = 'Fall 2019'
    GROUP BY l.line_id, s.station_id, l.line_name, s.station_name
) AS subquery
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY line_name ASC;
```

Here's what the subquery does:
- Join `rail_ridership` with `lines` and `stations` to get access to the line_name and station_name.
- Filter only 'Fall 2019' season records.
- Sum the `average_flow`, `average_ons`, and `average_offs` grouped by line_id and station_id.
- Use the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a ranking within each line_id (partition) based on the computed "bypassed ratio" in descending order.

The outer query then filters for only the top-ranked station (rn = 1) within each line, as identified by the `ROW_NUMBER` in the subquery, and assigns the computed bypassed_ratio value.

The final result is ordered by line_name in ascending order, as requested.
