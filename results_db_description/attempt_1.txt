PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we first need to determine what the average age of the singers is. Then we can select the song names from singers whose age is above this average. Here are the SQL queries for these steps:

```sql
-- Calculate the average age of the singers
SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer;
```

With this result, we can now write a SQL query to list the song names by singers whose age is above the average. Assuming we have the average age already calculated, let's say the average age is `avg_age`. Here's the query to get all song names for singers above that average age:

```sql
-- Replace `avg_age` with the actual average age value obtained from the previous query
SELECT Name, Song_Name FROM singer WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This second query uses a subquery to avoid hardcoding the average age. The subquery `(SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer)` is used to calculate the average age directly in the `WHERE` clause. The main query then selects the `Name` and `Song_Name` of singers who meet the age criteria.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 663
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the stadium name and capacity with the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to execute a query that counts how many times each stadium ID is referenced in the `concert` table for the given years, then join that result with the `stadium` table to get the corresponding stadium names and capacities. We will then select the stadium with the highest count.

Here is the SQL query to accomplish the task:

```sql
WITH StadiumConcertCount AS (
  SELECT
    c.Stadium_ID,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfConcerts
  FROM
    concert c
  WHERE
    c.Year >= '2014'
  GROUP BY
    c.Stadium_ID
  ORDER BY
    NumberOfConcerts DESC
  LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
  s.Name AS StadiumName,
  s.Capacity
FROM
  stadium s
JOIN
  StadiumConcertCount scc ON s.Stadium_ID = scc.Stadium_ID;
```

This query involves a couple of steps:
1. A Common Table Expression (CTE) named `StadiumConcertCount` is created to select the `Stadium_ID` and count the number of concerts (`NumberOfConcerts`) grouped by `Stadium_ID` for the years 2014 or after.
2. We order the results by `NumberOfConcerts` in descending order and use `LIMIT 1` to get the stadium with the most concerts.
3. We then join this CTE with the `stadium` table to find the name and capacity of the stadium.
4. The final result is the `StadiumName` and `Capacity` of the stadium with the most concerts from 2014 onwards.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find stadiums that have not hosted any concerts, we can use a LEFT JOIN to join the stadium table with the concert table on the `Stadium_ID` field and then filter the results to include only those stadiums where no corresponding `concert_ID` exists (i.e., where the `concert_ID` is NULL). Here is the query:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

Let me explain:
- `LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID` means we are taking all records from the stadium table and joining them with the concert table where the `Stadium_IDs` match.
- `WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL` filters the results to include only those rows where no concert exists for the stadium (meaning the join found no matching concert record for a stadium, which will result in NULL values for the columns from the concert table).

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To obtain the singer names and the number of concerts they have performed in, you would perform a JOIN operation between the `singer` and `singer_in_concert` tables and then group the results by the `Singer_ID` to count the number of concerts. Remember that in this schema, the `singer_in_concert` table creates a many-to-many relationship between `singer` and `concert`. Here's an SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT s.Name, COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Number_of_Concerts
FROM singer s
JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query works as follows:
- It selects the `Name` from the `singer` table (`s.Name`) and then counts the number of concert IDs (`COUNT(sic.concert_ID)`), which will be the number of concerts.
- The `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses join the `singer` table (`s`) and the `singer_in_concert` table (`sic`) where the `Singer_ID` matches.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `Singer_ID` (and `Name` for including non-aggregated column in the SELECT list) in order not to count the same singer multiple times for the same concert.
- The result is that each singer name is listed alongside the number of concerts they have performed in.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 669
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the name and country of origin of every singer who has a song with the word 'Hey' in its title, we can use the `LIKE` operator in SQL to filter the `Song_Name` based on the specified pattern. The query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT Name, Country
FROM singer
WHERE Song_Name LIKE '%Hey%';
```

This query will return all singers whose song name contains the word 'Hey', regardless of whether it appears at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the song title. The percent signs (`%`) are wildcard characters that allow for any characters to appear before or after 'Hey'.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 455
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students older than 20 years, you first need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table based on their common column (`StuID`), filter the results by the student age greater than 20, and then count the unique pet IDs.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Has_Pet.PetID) as NumberOfPets
FROM Student
JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID
WHERE Student.Age > 20;
```

This query joins the two tables on the `StuID` column, applies the filter for the student age, and then counts the distinct pet IDs to ensure each pet is only counted once. The result will show the total number of unique pets owned by students older than 20 years.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 457
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this request, you need to join the three tables altogether to count the number of dogs raised by female students. We can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(P.PetID) AS NumberOfDogPets
FROM Student S
JOIN Has_Pet HP ON S.StuID = HP.StuID
JOIN Pets P ON HP.PetID = P.PetID
WHERE S.Sex = 'F' AND P.PetType = 'dog';
```

In this query:

- We join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on their common `StuID` field.
- We then join the resulting table with the `Pets` table on their common `PetID` field.
- We filter the resulting table to include only female students by checking where `S.Sex` is 'F'.
- We also consider only dogs by checking where `P.PetType` is 'dog'.
- We count the number of pet IDs (`P.PetID`) which correspond to the pets that meet the criteria.

This will give us the count of dog pets raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 873
MODEL'S ANSWER: To calculate how many countries each continent has, we can use a `GROUP BY` clause on the `contId` column from the `continents` table along with a `JOIN` to the `countries` table. We can count the number of countries by using the `COUNT` aggregate function.

Here is the SQL query that will give us the desired result:

```sql
SELECT cont.ContId, cont.Continent, COUNT(coun.CountryId) AS Number_of_Countries
FROM continents cont
LEFT JOIN countries coun ON cont.ContId = coun.Continent
GROUP BY cont.ContId, cont.Continent
ORDER BY cont.ContId;
```

This query works as follows:

- We start by selecting the continent `ContId` and `Continent` from the `continents` table, as well as a count of country IDs from the `countries` table.
- We use a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `continents` table with the `countries` table on the `ContId` and `Continent` fields to ensure all continents are included even if they have no associated countries.
- We `GROUP BY` the continent `ContId` and `Continent` to ensure that the count function aggregates the number of countries for each continent.
- Finally, we `ORDER BY` the `ContId` to present the results in ascending order of continent IDs.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 871
MODEL'S ANSWER: To calculate the number of models each car maker produces and to output the maker's full name, ID, and the number of models, we can use a GROUP BY clause in combination with a COUNT aggregation function. Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT cm.FullName, cm.Id, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

Explanation of the Query:
1. We perform an INNER JOIN between the `car_makers` table (aliased as `cm`) and the `model_list` table (aliased as `ml`) on their respective columns that relate to the maker ID (`Id` and `Maker`).
2. We group the results by the car maker's ID and full name using the `GROUP BY` clause.
3. We count the number of models (`ModelId`) for each grouping with the `COUNT` function.
4. We select the car maker's full name (`FullName`), their ID, and the count of models (`NumberOfModels`) to display.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 873
MODEL'S ANSWER: To retrieve the full name of each car maker, its ID, and the number of models it produces, you need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table using a `LEFT JOIN` in case there are car makers that do not have any models. Then, use a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate the results by car maker, and a `COUNT` function to calculate the number of models for each car maker.

Here is the SQL query that performs this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    cm.Id,
    cm.FullName,
    COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM 
    car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN 
    model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY 
    cm.Id, cm.FullName;
```

This query will return a list of car makers with their IDs, full names, and how many models each one produces. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that if there are any car makers without models, they will still be included in the result set with a count of zero.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 862
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, we would first need to find the minimum value of the 'Horsepower' from the 'cars_data' table. After that, we would join the result with the 'car_names' table to get the model name. 

However, it's important to note that the 'Horsepower' column is of type TEXT, so a direct MIN function might not result in the correct value if the sorting isn't numerical. We need to cast it to an appropriate numeric type before we can find the minimum. Let's assume that 'Horsepower' can be converted to an INTEGER.

Here is a query to accomplish this task:

```sql
SELECT cn.Model, MIN(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) AS MinHorsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Horsepower NOT LIKE 'NULL'  -- Excluding rows where Horsepower is not a valid integer
GROUP BY cn.Model
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This SQL script first tries casting the 'Horsepower' to INTEGER, omitting entries where Horsepower is not given (using `NOT LIKE 'NULL'` to filter out 'Horsepower' values that are the text 'NULL' instead of a nullable type), then finds the minimum horsepower and associates it with the car's model, and limits the query to return only one entry, which would be the model with the absolute minimum horsepower.

Please note that there might be invalid or NULL entries in the 'Horsepower' column, so the `WHERE` clause excludes rows with 'NULL' placeholders. If 'Horsepower' could actually be NULL (in the SQL sense), the `WHERE` condition should be modified to `WHERE cd.Horsepower IS NOT NULL` instead. Additionally, you might have to adapt this script if horsepower data isn't properly formatted as numeric text or if different placeholder text is used.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 864
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the distinct car models produced after the year 1980, you will need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table and filter the results based on the `Year` column in the `cars_data` table. Assuming the `Year` column indicates the year the car was produced, you can write the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query will return the distinct car models where the corresponding `Year` in the `cars_data` table is greater than 1980.
