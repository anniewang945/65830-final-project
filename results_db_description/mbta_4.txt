Testing prompt 4:
For each station in each season, find the average number of line service days. (That is, find the average of the number of number_service_days over different lines, directions and time periods, but do not sum over different values for season.) Report the station name, season, and averaged number_service_days value, sorted by that average value in descending order. Break ties by sorting by season and then station name, both in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1097

Model's answer:
To calculate the average number of line service days for each station in each season, we will need to aggregate over the number of service days from the `rail_ridership` table and then join this with the `stations` table to get the station names. We then should group the results by the station name and season. Here's the corresponding SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.station_name, 
    r.season, 
    AVG(r.number_service_days) AS average_service_days
FROM 
    rail_ridership r
JOIN 
    stations s ON r.station_id = s.station_id
GROUP BY 
    s.station_name, 
    r.season
ORDER BY 
    average_service_days DESC, 
    r.season ASC,
    s.station_name ASC;
```

This query joins the `rail_ridership` table with the `stations` table using station IDs to access the station names, groups the results by station and season to calculate the average service days, and then orders by these average values in descending order. In case of ties, results will be ordered by season in ascending order and then by station name in ascending order.

For each station in each season, find the average number of line service days. (That is, find the average of the number of number_service_days over different lines, directions and time periods, but do not sum over different values for season.) Report the station name, season, and averaged number_service_days value, sorted by that average value in descending order. Break ties by sorting by season and then station name, both in ascending order.

Model's answer:
To tackle this request, we can use the SQL query to join relevant tables and calculate the average of `number_service_days` over different lines, directions, and time periods for each station and season. Then, we'll sort the results based on the computed average, season, and station name as per the instructions.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT
  st.station_name,
  rr.season,
  AVG(rr.number_service_days) AS avg_number_service_days
FROM
  rail_ridership rr
JOIN
  stations st ON rr.station_id = st.station_id
GROUP BY
  rr.station_id, rr.season
ORDER BY
  avg_number_service_days DESC,
  rr.season ASC,
  st.station_name ASC;
```

This query joins the `rail_ridership` table (aliased as `rr`) with the `stations` table (aliased as `st`) using the `station_id` as the join key. It then groups the results by the combined station and season. Within each group, it calculates the average of the `number_service_days` field.

Finally, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results first by the `avg_number_service_days` in descending order, then by `season` in ascending order, and lastly by `station_name` in ascending order, as requested.

Model's answer:
To find the average number of line service days for each station in each season, we have to join the `stations` table with the `rail_ridership` table, group by the station and season, and then calculate the average of the `number_service_days` field. The following SQL query achieves this:

```sql
SELECT s.station_name, r.season, AVG(r.number_service_days) AS average_service_days
FROM stations s
JOIN rail_ridership r ON s.station_id = r.station_id
GROUP BY s.station_name, r.season
ORDER BY average_service_days DESC, r.season ASC, s.station_name ASC;
```

This query performs the following steps:

1. Joins the `stations` table (`s`) with the `rail_ridership` table (`r`) on their `station_id` field.
2. Groups the results by `s.station_name` and `r.season`.
3. Calculates the average `number_service_days` within each group.
4. Orders the results by `average_service_days` in descending order, then by `season` in ascending order, and finally by `station_name` in ascending order.

Execute this query on your database to obtain the desired results.
