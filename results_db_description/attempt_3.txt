PASSING USER PROMPT: List all song names by singers above the average age .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list all song names by singers above the average age, we need to perform several steps in the SQL query:

1. Determine the average age of all singers.
2. Select the song names from the `singer` table where the singer's age is greater than the average age obtained in the first step.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.Song_Name
FROM 
    singer s
WHERE 
    s.Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM singer);
```

This query first calculates the average age of all singers by using the `AVG()` function on the Age column from the `singer` table in a subquery. Then, it selects the `Song_Name` from the `singer` table where the `Age` is greater than the average age calculated in the subquery.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the stadium name and capacity with most number of concerts in year 2014 or after .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 663
MODEL'S ANSWER: To show the stadium name and capacity that had the most number of concerts in the year 2014 or after, we need to:

1. Filter the concerts that occurred in the year 2014 and onwards.
2. Count the number of concerts at each stadium.
3. Select the stadium name and capacity that had the highest count of concerts.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
  s.Name,
  s.Capacity
FROM
  stadium s
JOIN
  concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE
  c.Year >= '2014'
GROUP BY
  s.Stadium_ID, s.Name, s.Capacity
ORDER BY
  COUNT(c.concert_ID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query performs the following steps:
- Joins the `stadium` table with the `concert` table on `Stadium_ID`.
- Filters the concerts that occurred in the year 2014 or after using the `WHERE` clause with `c.Year >= '2014'`.
- Groups the results by `Stadium_ID`, `s.Name`, and `s.Capacity` in order to calculate the count of concerts for each stadium.
- Orders the results in descending order by the count of concerts.
- Limits the results to the top row using `LIMIT 1`, which will be the stadium with the most concerts since 2014.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What are the names of the stadiums without any concerts ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the names of stadiums where no concerts have taken place, we need to perform a LEFT JOIN between the "stadium" table and the "concert" table on their respective "Stadium_ID" fields and then identify the rows where there is no corresponding entry in the "concert" table.

Here is the SQL query to find the names of such stadiums:

```sql
SELECT s.Name
FROM stadium s
LEFT JOIN concert c ON s.Stadium_ID = c.Stadium_ID
WHERE c.concert_ID IS NULL;
```

This query selects the stadium names (`s.Name`) from the stadium table (`s`), performs a LEFT JOIN with the concert table (`c`) based on the Stadium_ID, and filters for the rows where `c.concert_ID` is NULL, which indicates that the stadium has no associated concert records.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Show the name and theme for all concerts and the number of singers in each concert .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 661
MODEL'S ANSWER: To fulfill this request, you will need to join the 'concert' table with the 'singer_in_concert' table and use an aggregate function (`COUNT`) to count the number of singers in each concert. You can then group by the concert ID to ensure you get the counts per concert.

Here is the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT
  c.concert_Name,
  c.Theme,
  COUNT(sic.Singer_ID) AS Number_of_Singers
FROM
  concert c
LEFT JOIN singer_in_concert sic
  ON c.concert_ID = sic.concert_ID
GROUP BY
  c.concert_ID;
```

This query selects the concert name and theme from the 'concert' table (`c`) and counts the number of singers by counting the occurrences of Singer_ID in the 'singer_in_concert' table (`sic`), with a LEFT JOIN to include concerts with no singers. The results are grouped by the concert ID to ensure that each concert is represented once with the corresponding count of singers.

PASSING USER PROMPT: List singer names and number of concerts for each singer .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 655
MODEL'S ANSWER: To list the singer names and the number of concerts each singer has performed in, you would need to join the `singer` table with the `singer_in_concert` table and then perform a COUNT() aggregation for the number of concerts. The query would look like the following:

```sql
SELECT s.Name AS Singer_Name, COUNT(sic.concert_ID) AS Number_of_Concerts
FROM singer s
JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID
GROUP BY s.Singer_ID, s.Name;
```

This query joins the `singer` table (aliased as `s`) and the `singer_in_concert` table (aliased as `sic`) on their respective `Singer_ID` fields. It then groups the results by singer's ID and name to ensure that each singer is listed only once, and counts the number of concert IDs (`sic.concert_ID`) to give the number of concerts each has performed in. The columns are aliased as `Singer_Name` and `Number_of_Concerts` for clarity.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many pets are owned by students that have an age greater than 20 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 455
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many pets are owned by students over the age of 20, you need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on the `StuID` column and then count the distinct number of pets based on the `PetID`. Here is the SQL query that will give you the information you are looking for:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID) AS Number_of_Pets
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
WHERE s.Age > 20;
```

This query selects the distinct `PetID`s from the `Has_Pet` table where the `StuID` matches the `StuID` in the `Student` table and the age of the student is greater than 20. The `COUNT(DISTINCT hp.PetID)` function ensures that each pet is counted only once, even if it appears multiple times in the `Has_Pet` table (which shouldn't happen if the primary key constraint is working correctly, but it's still good practice to use `DISTINCT` in COUNT queries when you want to make sure duplicates aren't counted).

PASSING USER PROMPT: Find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students ( with sex F ) .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 457
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the number of dog pets that are raised by female students, we need to join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table to link students to their pets, and then join the result with the `Pets` table to determine the types of pets. We only want to count the dog-type pets that belong to female students, so we will also add the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause.

Here is the query to do so:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfDogPetsByFemaleStudents
FROM Student s
JOIN Has_Pet hp ON s.StuID = hp.StuID
JOIN Pets p ON hp.PetID = p.PetID
WHERE s.Sex = 'F' AND p.PetType = 'dog';
```

This query joins the three tables based on their relationships, using the foreign keys to make the connections. It filters the result set to only include female students (`s.Sex = 'F'`) and only pets that are dogs (`p.PetType = 'dog'`), and then counts the number of rows that match these criteria, which corresponds to the number of dogs raised by female students.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many countries does each continent have ? List the continent id , continent name and the number of countries .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 873
MODEL'S ANSWER: To answer this question, you'll need to join the "continents" table with the "countries" table and count the number of countries for each continent. Here's the SQL query that does that:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.ContId, 
    c.Continent, 
    COUNT(ct.CountryId) AS NumberOfCountries
FROM 
    continents AS c
LEFT JOIN 
    countries AS ct ON c.ContId = ct.Continent
GROUP BY 
    c.ContId
ORDER BY 
    c.ContId;
```

This SQL query performs a LEFT JOIN to include all continents even if they don't have any countries associated with them. The query groups results by continent ID and counts the number of country IDs for each group. The result will include the continent ID, continent name, and the number of countries associated with each continent. The ORDER BY clause ensures the results are sorted by continent ID.

PASSING USER PROMPT: How many models does each car maker produce ? List maker full name , id and the number .
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 871
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find out how many models each car maker produces, we can perform a `JOIN` operation between the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables, and then use the `COUNT` function along with `GROUP BY` to count the number of models per car maker. Here's the SQL query to get the information on maker full name, their id, and the number of models they produce:

```sql
SELECT cm.FullName, cm.Id, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker -- This JOIN ensures we only consider models from existing car makers
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName -- Groups the results by car maker's id and full name
ORDER BY NumberOfModels DESC; -- (Optional) This will order the results by the number of models, descending
```

This query joins the `car_makers` table (aliased as cm) and the `model_list` table (aliased as ml), links them by their corresponding `Id` and `Maker` columns (the car maker's id), groups the results by the car maker's `Id` (which is the same as `Maker` in the model_list) and `FullName`, counts the number of entries (models) for each group, and then selects the `FullName`, `Id`, and the count, which we've aliased as `NumberOfModels`. If you want the results sorted by the number of models each maker produces, you can include the `ORDER BY` clause as well.

PASSING USER PROMPT: What is the full name of each car maker , along with its id and how many models it produces ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 873
MODEL'S ANSWER: To get the full name of each car maker along with its id and the count of models it produces, we need to join the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table based on the car maker's id and then group the results by the car maker's id to count the number of models. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT cm.Id AS MakerId,
       cm.FullName AS CarMakerFullName,
       COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS NumberOfModels
FROM car_makers cm
LEFT JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.FullName
```

This query selects the id and full name from `car_makers` and counts the number of models associated with each car maker using the `COUNT` function. We use a `LEFT JOIN` to make sure we include car makers that might not have any models listed. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by each car maker's id, allowing the `COUNT` aggregate function to compute the number of models for each car maker.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which model of the car has the minimum horsepower ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 862
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find the model of the car with the minimum horsepower, you will first need to identify the minimum value of horsepower from the `cars_data` table, and then join the resulting row with the `car_names` and `model_list` tables to retrieve the corresponding model name. Please note that the `Horsepower` column is of type TEXT according to your schema, therefore we need to convert it to an integer for it to be properly compared.

Assuming that there are no non-numeric values in the `Horsepower` column, you can use the following SQL query to find the model with the minimum horsepower:

```sql
SELECT mn.Model, min(CAST(cd.Horsepower AS INTEGER)) as MinHorsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
JOIN model_list ml ON cn.Model = ml.Model
WHERE cd.Horsepower <> 'NA' -- exclude any non-applicable horsepower values
GROUP BY ml.Model
ORDER BY MinHorsepower ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the model of the car with the minimum horsepower. The `CAST` function is used to convert the `Horsepower` from TEXT to INTEGER. The `WHERE` clause is used to avoid errors if there are non-numeric values like 'NA'. The `GROUP BY` clause is included to cover the scenario where there might be multiple entries for a model with different horsepower values, although the model names are unique according to the schema (`UNIQUE` constraint in the `model_list`). The `ORDER BY` clause orders the result set by the minimum horsepower in ascending order, and the `LIMIT 1` clause limits the result to only one row - the one with the minimum horsepower.

PASSING USER PROMPT: Which distinct car models are the produced after 1980 ?
TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS IN THE CURRENT PROMPT: 864
MODEL'S ANSWER: To find distinct car models produced after 1980, you would need to join the `car_names` and `cars_data` tables on the `MakeId` column since the `cars_data` table contains the `Year` column which specifies the year of creation for each car. After joining these tables, you can filter the results by the `Year` value being greater than 1980.

Here's the SQL query to retrieve such data:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cn.Model
FROM car_names cn
JOIN cars_data cd
ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Year > 1980;
```

This query selects the distinct `Model` from the `car_names` table, joins it with the `cars_data` table based on the `MakeId`, and filters the records where the `Year` is greater than 1980.
