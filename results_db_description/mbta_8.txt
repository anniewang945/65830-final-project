Testing prompt 8:
Find the station with most number of routes passing through it. (E.g. North Station has six routes passing through it: orange line in both directions and two green lines in both directions) Report station_name, route_id, line_id, and total number of routes passing through the station. Sort the results by line_id in ascending order and then route_id in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1084

Model's answer:
To find the station with the most number of routes passing through it, we need to join the `station_orders` table with the `stations` and `routes` tables. This will allow us to count the distinct routes for each station. Then, we can order the results based on the number of routes passing through each station to find out which one has the most. We'll also order the results as requested by `line_id` and then `route_id`.

Here's the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    sta.station_name,
    so.route_id,
    ro.line_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) as total_routes
FROM 
    station_orders so
INNER JOIN 
    stations sta ON so.station_id = sta.station_id
INNER JOIN 
    routes ro ON so.route_id = ro.route_id
GROUP BY 
    sta.station_name,
    so.route_id,
    ro.line_id
ORDER BY 
    total_routes DESC,
    ro.line_id ASC,
    so.route_id ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

Please note that this query will return only one stationâ€”the one with the highest total number of routes passing through it, as requested. If there are multiple stations with the same highest number of routes, this query will return the one that comes first based on the sorting by `line_id` and then `route_id`. If you want all stations with the highest number, you would first run a query to determine the highest count, then use that in a `HAVING` clause to filter for all stations with that count.

However, the query above has one limitation: it assumes that each direction of a route counts as a separate route. If we instead want to count each route only once, regardless of the direction, we would need to modify the query to use `COUNT(DISTINCT ro.route_id)` instead. Furthermore, the instructions ask for stations with multiple routes, but not necessarily in both directions, so it's ambiguous whether we should count the directions separately or not. The provided query counts each direction separately as distinct routes. If this is not the desired behavior, the query should be adjusted accordingly.

Find the station with most number of routes passing through it. (E.g. North Station has six routes passing through it: orange line in both directions and two green lines in both directions) Report station_name, route_id, line_id, and total number of routes passing through the station. Sort the results by line_id in ascending order and then route_id in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1084

Model's answer:
To find the station with the most number of routes passing through it, we need to count the distinct routes for each station and then retrieve the station with the maximum count. The SQL query involves selecting data from `station_orders` and `stations` and joining them to get the station names and counting the distinct routes for each station using a GROUP BY clause. Then we'll need to retrieve the list of routes and the associated line IDs for the highest count station.

Here is the query to achieve the task:

```sql
SELECT
  s.station_name,
  so.route_id,
  r.line_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) OVER (PARTITION BY so.station_id) AS total_routes
FROM
  station_orders so
JOIN
  stations s ON so.station_id = s.station_id
JOIN
  routes r ON so.route_id = r.route_id
GROUP BY
  so.station_id, s.station_name, so.route_id, r.line_id
ORDER BY
  MAX(total_routes) DESC,
  r.line_id ASC,
  so.route_id ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

First, we join `station_orders` with `stations` and `routes` on `station_id` and `route_id` to get the required attributes. Then we count the distinct `route_id` for each `station_id`. We use window function `COUNT() OVER (PARTITION BY station_id)` to get the count for each station next to the station's row data. We sort the stations with the most routes at the top using `ORDER BY MAX(total_routes) DESC` which maximizes the `total_routes`, and then sort by `line_id` and `route_id` as per the instructions. Finally, we use `LIMIT 1` to get the top result. 

Please note that this will give us one station with the most routes. If multiple stations have the same highest number of routes passing through, this query will return only one of them randomly. If the requirement is to show all such stations, we would need to use a subquery to first find the maximum count and then filter for stations matching that count.

Testing prompt 8:
Find the station with most number of routes passing through it. (E.g. North Station has six routes passing through it: orange line in both directions and two green lines in both directions) Report station_name, route_id, line_id, and total number of routes passing through the station. Sort the results by line_id in ascending order and then route_id in ascending order.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1084

Model's answer:
To find the station with the most number of routes passing through it, we need to count the distinct `route_id` for each `station_id` from the `station_orders` table and then join this with the `stations` and `routes` table to get the `station_name`, `route_id`, and `line_id`. After we count the routes per station, we will identify the station with the maximum count, but since there might be a tie, we need to consider multiple stations with the same maximum count.

Let's begin by finding stations with their corresponding count of distinct routes:

```sql
SELECT so.station_id, COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) as route_count
FROM station_orders so
GROUP BY so.station_id
```

This will give us the count of distinct routes passing through each station. Now we need to join this with the `stations` table to get the `station_name`, and then join with the `routes` table to get the `route_id` and `line_id`. We can then find the maximum route count and use that to filter out the stations of interest:

```sql
WITH RouteCounts AS (
    SELECT so.station_id, COUNT(DISTINCT so.route_id) as total_routes
    FROM station_orders so
    GROUP BY so.station_id
),
MaxRouteCount AS (
    SELECT MAX(total_routes) as max_routes
    FROM RouteCounts
),
TopStations AS (
    SELECT rc.station_id, rc.total_routes
    FROM RouteCounts rc
    JOIN MaxRouteCount mrc ON rc.total_routes = mrc.max_routes
)
SELECT s.station_name, r.route_id, r.line_id, ts.total_routes
FROM TopStations ts
JOIN stations s ON ts.station_id = s.station_id
JOIN station_orders so ON ts.station_id = so.station_id
JOIN routes r ON so.route_id = r.route_id
GROUP BY s.station_name, r.route_id, r.line_id, ts.total_routes
ORDER BY r.line_id ASC, r.route_id ASC;
```

This SQL query first calculates the `total_routes` for each station, then finds the station(s) with the maximum number of routes. After that, we select and group the relevant data by `station_name`, `route_id`, `line_id`, and `total_routes`. Finally, we conclude with ordering the results by `line_id` in ascending order and then `route_id` in ascending order. The presented result will show each station with the highest number of routes once, along with each of those routes, sorted as requested.
