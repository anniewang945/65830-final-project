Testing prompt 1:
Find the first and last station for each route on each line. Report the line name, route direction name, and first and last station name. Sort the results by the line name, direction name, first station name, and then last station name, all in ascending order.

Model's answer:
To get the first and last station for each route on each line, we need to join together data from multiple tables: `lines`, `routes`, `stations`, and perhaps the `station_orders` table if we need to confirm the order of the stations. However, since we're given the IDs of the first and last stations in the `routes` table, we may not need `station_orders`.

Here is the SQL query that performs the necessary joins and fetches the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.line_name,
    r.direction_desc AS route_direction_name,
    fs.station_name AS first_station_name,
    ls.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM 
    routes r
INNER JOIN 
    lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
INNER JOIN 
    stations fs ON r.first_station_id = fs.station_id
INNER JOIN 
    stations ls ON r.last_station_id = ls.station_id
ORDER BY 
    l.line_name ASC, 
    r.direction_desc ASC,
    fs.station_name ASC,
    ls.station_name ASC;
```

This query joins the `routes` table with the `lines` table on the `line_id` to get the line names, then joins with the `stations` table twice - once on the `first_station_id` and once on the `last_station_id` to get the names of the first and last stations for each route. Finally, the results are ordered according to the specifications in the request.

Model's answer:
The information requested involves joining multiple tables: `lines`, `routes`, and `stations`. We want first and last station names for each route, which requires us to know which stations correspond to the `first_station_id` and `last_station_id` in the `routes` table. Additionally, we need to join the `routes` table with the `lines` table to get the line names. 

Here is the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.line_name,
    r.direction_desc,
    fs.station_name AS first_station_name,
    ls.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM 
    routes r
JOIN 
    lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
JOIN 
    stations fs ON r.first_station_id = fs.station_id
JOIN 
    stations ls ON r.last_station_id = ls.station_id
ORDER BY 
    l.line_name ASC, 
    r.direction_desc ASC, 
    fs.station_name ASC, 
    ls.station_name ASC;
```

This SQL query should produce the desired result, listing the first and last stations of each route, along with the line name and route direction description, sorted according to the requirements.

Model's answer:
To retrieve the first and last station for each route on each line, and provide the result with the specified sorting, we need to join several tables: the `lines` table to get the line name, the `routes` table to get route and direction information, and the `stations` table twice - once to get the first station name and once to get the last station name.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    l.line_name,
    r.direction_desc AS route_direction_name,
    sf.station_name AS first_station_name,
    sl.station_name AS last_station_name
FROM 
    routes r
INNER JOIN lines l ON
    r.line_id = l.line_id
INNER JOIN stations sf ON
    r.first_station_id = sf.station_id
INNER JOIN stations sl ON
    r.last_station_id = sl.station_id
ORDER BY 
    l.line_name ASC, 
    r.direction_desc ASC, 
    sf.station_name ASC, 
    sl.station_name ASC;
```

This SQL query joins the necessary tables based on their foreign key relationships and selects the corresponding information for the line name, route direction name, and the names of the first and last stations of each route. It then orders the results by line name, route direction name, first station name, and last station name, all in ascending order.
