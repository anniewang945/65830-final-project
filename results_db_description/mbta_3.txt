Testing prompt 3:
Find the total length in miles and number of stations of each line’s routes. Report the route_id, direction, route_name, number of stations, and length in miles for each route. Exclude the Green Line since the distance between stations is missing. Sort the results by total number of stations in descending order (break tie using total length in miles in descending).

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1081

Model's answer:
To calculate the total length in miles and number of stations for each route, you need to sum the distances and count the stations from the `station_orders` table. We will join this with the `routes` table and exclude routes corresponding to the Green Line. The result will be grouped by `route_id`, `direction`, and `route_name` and sorted by the total number of stations in descending order with a secondary sort on the total length in miles in descending order.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.route_id,
    r.direction_desc AS direction,
    r.route_name,
    COUNT(so.station_id) AS number_of_stations,
    SUM(so.distance_from_last_station_miles) AS length_in_miles
FROM 
    routes r
INNER JOIN 
    station_orders so ON r.route_id = so.route_id
INNER JOIN 
    lines l ON r.line_id = l.line_id
WHERE 
    l.line_name <> 'Green'
GROUP BY 
    r.route_id, r.direction_desc, r.route_name
ORDER BY
    number_of_stations DESC, length_in_miles DESC;
```

Please note that this query assumes that the distances in the `station_orders` table are cumulative. If the distances are actually incrementally added from the previous station, the calculation remains the same. The first station in each route with 0 distance will not affect the sum. Also, all Green Line distances are set to NULL, so those routes will be excluded from this query based on the WHERE condition that filters out any routes where the `line_name` is 'Green'.

Testing prompt 3:
Find the total length in miles and number of stations of each line’s routes. Report the route_id, direction, route_name, number of stations, and length in miles for each route. Exclude the Green Line since the distance between stations is missing. Sort the results by total number of stations in descending order (break tie using total length in miles in descending).

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1081

Model's answer:
To calculate the total length in miles and the number of stations for each route, excluding the Green Line, we can follow these steps in our SQL query:

1. Join the `station_orders` and `routes` tables on `route_id` to get the distance information corresponding to each route while excluding the Green Line.
2. Group the results by route to aggregate the distance and count the number of stations.
3. Order the results by the total number of stations in descending order and then by the total length in miles in descending order.

The query for that would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    ro.route_id,
    ro.direction_desc AS direction,
    ro.route_name,
    COUNT(distinct so.station_id) AS number_of_stations,
    COALESCE(SUM(so.distance_from_last_station_miles), 0) as total_length_miles
FROM 
    station_orders so
JOIN 
    routes ro
ON 
    so.route_id = ro.route_id
JOIN
    lines l
ON 
    ro.line_id = l.line_id AND l.line_name != 'Green Line'
GROUP BY 
    ro.route_id, ro.direction_desc, ro.route_name
ORDER BY 
    number_of_stations DESC, 
    total_length_miles DESC;
```

Here, the `COALESCE` function is used to substitute a zero value for any sum that returns `NULL` due to airport stations that may have no previous station (thus a distance of 0). This could happen if the starting station for a route is an airport station or for routes that only consist of an airport station. Since the Green Line distances are set to `NULL`, the `COALESCE` function ensures the total length is considered 0 for the Green Line, which we have already excluded with the join condition on the `lines` table.

TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS: 1081

Model's answer:
To calculate the total length in miles and the number of stations for each route, we will sum the distances from the `station_orders` table and count the number of stations from the same table for each route.

The query for this would be:

```sql
SELECT
  ro.route_id,
  ro.direction_desc AS direction,
  ro.route_name,
  COUNT(so.station_id) AS number_of_stations,
  SUM(so.distance_from_last_station_miles) AS length_in_miles
FROM
  station_orders so
JOIN
  routes ro ON so.route_id = ro.route_id
JOIN
  lines li ON ro.line_id = li.line_id
WHERE
  li.line_name <> 'Green'
GROUP BY
  ro.route_id, ro.direction_desc, ro.route_name
ORDER BY
  number_of_stations DESC,
  length_in_miles DESC;
```

In this query, we're making a couple of assumptions:

1. There's an implicit assumption that the sum of the distances from `station_orders` will result in the total length of each route. This is typically true given the data should represent paths from the first to the last station on a route.
2. The Green Line is being excluded by checking that `line_name` is not equal to `Green` in a WHERE clause.

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results first by the total number of stations in descending order, and in case of a tie, by the total length in miles in descending order.
